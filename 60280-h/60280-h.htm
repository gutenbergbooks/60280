<h2 class="chapheadleft">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subhead">PRELUDE</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> first thing that impresses me as I begin this short book on
London is the large number of subjects of which I will say nothing.
There are many reasons for this. One is that a title such as <i>A
London Mosaic</i> is as difficult to compose to as <i>Life</i> or <i>Love</i>. (Two
novels are still on sale under these somewhat atlasian titles, but
as an author does not wish to be unkind in the first paragraphs
of a book, they need not be reviewed.) Another reason is that
Mr E. V. Lucas, Mrs E. T. Cook, John o’ London, Mr G. R.
Sims, have compiled various volumes of passionate Baedeker,
and I hesitate to set my feet in their mighty footprints. For so
much of this London is unknown to me, and I have learnt little
of her, indeed, learned little except to love her. Thus, in this
book, you will find no lists of houses where famous people lived.
This may seem strange, but it wakes in me no thrill to see a
circular plate of debased wedgwood imposed by a maternal L.C.C.
upon a wall of innocent stucco coated with eternal dirt. To read
that William Hazlitt died here, or lived there, does not add much
to the fact that William Hazlitt lived. It may be interesting to know
that Hazlitt chose that sort of house, though it is likely that he
did not choose it, but accepted it; a house does not define a man
of worth, for men of worth are mostly poor, and their houses
reflect them not. Many must have hated them. Yet, I happen
to know Huxley’s house in St John’s Wood, and Carlyle’s house
in Chelsea (there is no getting over that one when friends arrive
from America), but it is not exciting knowledge, and I incline to
rejoice with Kingsley that it is not the house one lives in matters,
but the house opposite. Unfortunately, the house opposite is
generally just as bad: the only thing that reconciles one to one’s
house is that the people opposite see most of it.</p>

<p>I shall not tell you anything of ‘quaint corners,’ or ‘picturesque
bits.’ I will not cut up and pickle London. Ever since the days
of Dickens (or is it since those of Dr Syntax?) people have ranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
our unfortunate town armed with a butterfly-net: swoop! caught
Cloth Fair! Another swoop! Staple Inn lies in the butterfly-net.
Quick, into the pickle-jar. Now for the cyanide. Here they are,
London butterflies, ready for delineation by Mr Hugh Thompson.
No, I will pickle you no living strips of London Town, and I
promise that not once will I portray a humorous bus-conductor.
One reason is that there are no humorous bus-conductors; there
are only raucous brutes, working long hours, and maintained in
a state of pessimism because these long hours separate them
from the public-house. They do not, however, separate them
enough.</p>

<p>There will be no East in the West, nor West in the East.
There will be no list of statues, for nobody ever looks at statues.
There is a statue of George Stephenson at Euston, and one of
William Pitt in Hanover Square. That is very interesting, isn’t
it? It is a terrible commentary upon fame that when you erect
a statue to a man he becomes invisible. You pass a statue every
day, but you never look at it, you pass it. Nobody cares for
statues, except the birds, who make them a venue for love and war.
Christopher Wren did say that if you required a monument you
should look about you; thus does the London population. Those
who have noticed Mr Peabody, miraculously encased in a frock
coat several sizes too small, Mr Huskisson stark naked, and one
of the Georges on his little horse, trotting to nowhere in particular,
as was the way of his dynasty, will agree that it is no wonder
statues fail to arouse even merriment.</p>

<p>No, there are no statues in this book. There are no pictures
either. I shall not tell you how to find the Madonna degli Ansidei
in the National Gallery, nor direct you to the Flaxmans of
University College. The catalogues can do that. That is, if
you want to know, and are not one of the ordinary beings who
use the museums to get out of the rain or for the innocent purposes
of courtship. (I recommend the Geological; chilly, but leads to
concentration). Sometimes, in remorseful mood, when the word
‘ought,’ which as a rule means little to me, suddenly assumes
material shape to the extent of a faint mist, I tell myself that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
very uneducated, and regrettably unrepentant, that I ‘ought’
to care that Swift lived in Bury Street and Sir Isaac Newton in
Jermyn Street, and that I ‘ought’ to find desecration in the fact
that where the dog Diamond barked, the plates of Jules’s Balkan
waiters clatter. And I go to Jules’s to lunch and to meditate on
gravitation. But Jules can cook, and while eating his meats you
do not meditate; and he is so popular that as soon as you have
finished those meats, you are driven out by the eyes of some young
couple, beaming with love and appetite. Nor may you meditate
opposite the houses of the great; it annoys the police. So, after
this faint attempt, the slender ‘ought’ evaporates. Perhaps
because of that I have not yet succeeded in visiting the Tower,
the Roman Bath, the Foundling, the Soane Museum, the Mint,
and many other places which doubtless would improve my
mind.</p>

<p>I am not a student, but a lover of London; it amuses me
much more to notice that one man shouts: ‘Paw Maw! Exper!
Paw Maw!’ while another does it like this: ‘Per Mer! Gateshpozervenment!’
than to bask in the knowledge that Johnson
lived in Gough Square. This arises, I suppose, from having taken
London as I found her, and from not being a Londoner. The
first twenty years of my life having been spent in another country,
I did not treat London as a relation, but as some one whom I
liked. Everything of her was interesting, and there is to-day no
mews where I cannot hear the footsteps of her smutty nymphs.
The entry into London is such a romantic march; I say march
because it is worth doing on foot. But as I speak to Londoners,
we had better do it by train, for they would grow tired of her.
When Londoners say ‘London,’ they mean Piccadilly, Selfridges,
Covent Garden, that sort of thing, and that is not London. London
is Tottenham and Chiswick, the ‘Paragon,’ Mile End, Walker’s
Court and what it sells, and the black doss places under the railway
arches. London is Houndsditch, where everybody looks bad,
and Cornwall Gardens where everybody looks good. London
is a congress-house of emotions.</p>

<p>When one looks at the map, particularly if it is on a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
scale, London looks like a splash, rather longer than it is broad,
with railway lines radiating in all directions, rather like a spider’s
web, the centre being tenanted by whoever you like. And one
thinks of Dick Whittington gaily treading in the spider’s web.
But, in fact, one does not come out of the everywhere into the here
of London. One melts into London, and one hardly knows how
one comes to abandon the rest of the world. There is a moment
when the Essex or Kentish marsh ceases to lap so uniformly
against Medway or Thames. One has a sense of population, of
rather large houses set rather far apart, but not yet so far apart
as in the counties; of grounds less richly endowed with the high
walls crowned with broken glass which announce that respectable
people live inside. One reads names on the platforms: ‘Brentwood,’
or ‘Malling,’ and there is a sprinkling of villas, with plenty
of white paint and concrete, and red roofs and leaded panes. One
glimpses cerise curtains, and one knows with painful accuracy
where to look for the back of the swing mirror. Then, again, gaps,
cows. It must have been a mistake, it is not London after all!
But there come more platforms and more villas, then a row of
shops, shops not branded with the names one would expect to
find, such as ‘Boots’ or ‘Home and Colonial,’ but brisk, individual
little shops belonging to Smith, and to Jones, yet strangely alike
in build, furnished by the same shopfitter, just as the owners will
be buried by the same undertaker. (He is quite ready, for he
owns one of the shops.) That is individualism, which, like the
camomile plant, is ever bruised and ever arises.</p>

<p>The train rumbles on, and the houses change. They are still
detached, but less detached: they are separated by privet hedges
over which a man can look, and so they have an air of fellowship.
Suddenly, one enters a little colony of houses; one sees a postman
on foot instead of on a bicycle, a horse omnibus and no carrier’s
cart; one sees a policeman too: the world is growing less respectable;
it must be London after all. But again come gaps and cows,
except that now the gaps are described as ‘desirable freehold sites’
with loudly advertised frontages. The earth is already torn up,
and excavations are turning into roads; one observes a solitary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
gas-lamp, and on a board the words ‘Macedonia Avenue.’ No
avenue is built yet, but it is foredoomed to Macedonia.</p>

THE REGENT CANAL<br />

<p>All that is the overflow of London; it is the fugitive London
which has no love or understanding of the town. The movement
of a Londoner who rises in life seems to follow a definite curve;
if he begins in Whitechapel the wheel of fortune may take him to
Streatham; after a while he will dream of a place in the country
and realise his dream perhaps at Purley Oaks; by the time his son
has come back from Oxford, his wife will have been ambitious
enough to remove him to South Kensington; thence, the last
step, to God’s quadrilateral between Oxford Street and Piccadilly,
Regent Street, and Park Lane. After the bankruptcy the process
is reversed. Outward, then inward, and outward again. It is
like the tide.</p>

<p>But the train goes on, and unexpectedly, we find age after
youth, Croydon, Sydenham, Edmonton, places where again the
walls are high, the oaks thick, where are deep lawns, heavy stucco
fronts, little crowded streets with spreading market places. We
breathe the air of genteel sleep. Genteel, perhaps, but restless
sleep, for these are old villages made into islands.</p>

<p>They seem vaguely annoyed among the trams; they blink at
the sky-signs and the objurgations of Bovril. But it is too late;
round each little group run fifty streets, each one comprising a
hundred houses or so, all complete, with Nottingham lace curtain
and Virginia creeper. The old house may call itself ‘The Lodge,’
but ‘Chatsworth’ and ‘Greville Towers’ are round the corner.
Indeed, we forget them as we go on, for now, as the train roars
over railway bridges, through cuttings, we look down on the
endless congestion of suburban roofs, each one separated from its
neighbour by what the builder regrettably calls a ‘worm.’</p>

<p>And yet it is not London. For London has yet to burst upon
our eyes, in the shape of strident Clapham Road, or Brixton
Road, true London of the black, greasy pavement and the orange
peel of which Private Ortheris babbled in his delirium. We
have still to come to the giant warehouses and their ambitious
grayness, to the flat mass of gray, yellow, and black, broken only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
by the washing that hangs to dry, and the narrow gardens where
droops the nasturtium. At last here is working London, little,
nestling, hard, grimy London, gritty, troglodyte London, London
of crowded shop and public-house, of tramway and clotted traffic,
and yelping children. That is London of many heads and, to me,
all smiling.</p>

<p>It is only later, when at last we reach the river that is gray as
a cygnet, and see London rising in a hundred solemn spires, that
we come to understand London, to feel the use of that white,
central pomp; as well of that opulence as of the smiling cleanliness
of the outer ring, of the blackness of the inner ring. For all that
is part of London’s world, and it is well that she should, within
herself, comprise all ugliness and all beauty. For this makes her
worth exploring.</p>

<p>The secret of a city’s exploration does not lie in the dutiful
following of itineraries, but rather in a lover-like submission to
its moods. One should eat in various places, not only within the
stereotyped square mile which, in London, in Paris, or in Petrograd,
is loudly labelled as the foreigner’s restaurant. One must seek
culinary adventure far afield, at Harrow, and at Tulse Hill, in
Piccadilly and Norton Folgate; and let me assure you that there
exists a subtle difference between the cooking at the Cheapside
A.B.C. and its fellow in the Brixton Road.</p>

<p>Also one should readily cede to the fancy that is bred by a
beautiful place name. It is true that, as a rule, the most attractive
names lead to the least attractive places, but on the way one touches
singularity often, and beauty sometimes. My Baedeker has
always been Kelly’s Directory; that is one of the books I should
like to find in my restricted library if I were wrecked on a desert
island. For, sitting under my bread-fruit tree, warm in my
garment of yakskin, and smoking an earthen pipe of dried I don’t
know what leaf, Kelly’s Directory would bring up dreams, dreams
such as these: Seven Sisters’ Road, Satchwell Rents, Beer Lane,
and Whetstone Park. All those dreams have come true, and thus
a little of my fervour has been abated by their materialisation; by
the discovery of Seven Sisters’ Road as gray, refuse-strewn, rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
in Victorian goodness and in modern slum; of Satchwell Rents
as a dusty affluent into Bethnal Green Road, shuttered, and locked,
and suspicious. Whetstone Park, of course, is not at Whetstone,
but just off New Oxford Street, and there is no park there. But
still, those names, like Orme Square, that secludes itself from the
Bayswater Road behind its column and its defiant eagle, like
Cumberland Market, Hanoverian, naked, whose many iron posts
await cattle that never come, contain the seed of romance because
they induce quest. And so I will not be discouraged yet, but soon
must discover what stones have wrought Jedburgh Street and
Parsifal Road.</p>

<p>Yet those streets, and roads, and squares that have their place
in Kelly are, after all, only the outer shell which the true lover
must break through. If he is a true lover, he will soon understand
that London lies behind the streets. He will realise that between
two streets there is often more than two rows of houses and of
gardens or yards. He will have discovered that in the core of
those blocks of masonry lives an inner London. Into that core
there is but one way, which I will call the slits. We all know
slits, little spaces between houses, that lead inwards, you know not
whither. You pass them every day, perhaps, and never turn
aside, yet through those slits is the way in. There is one, for
instance, near Notting Hill Gate. They call it Bulmer Place,
though it is only six feet broad and is buried under an archway.
Enter; ten yards lead you to an old cottage settlement, where no
house exceeds two floors, where each has its garden, its creeper
and its cat, where washing floats undisturbed, and, on fine afternoons,
public beanoes take place. This is an old London village,
caught between the warehouses and shops, yet maintained by the
magic law of ancient lights.</p>

<p>There is another slit, less well known, quite near Kensington
Square. To the ordinary eye, Kensington Square is entirely
civilised, and none live there unless they have both money and
good taste. In the far south-west corner stands a convent, that
stares forth blankly upon this world. But walk south-east and
turn to the right, and go on until, past low, white cottages grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
with sterile vine, you meet a brick wall. On the way, small houses,
well locked, that are quiet and green, will have seen you pass
without approval. If adventure is not for you, you will turn back
on seeing the brick wall; if, however, it is, you will go on, and,
on your right, find a slit so small that you may not open your
umbrella in it. This they call South End; if you persevere you
shall come to rustic cottages of plaster, and at last discover, single-floored
against the side of a great block of flats, the cottage and
garden where rot two old green, painted figure-heads. There
live Prunella, Mityl, Selysette, and their tribe. But go carefully
to South End, for the road is fugitive, and I cannot always find
it myself. I think I find it only on the days when I am not too
impure in heart.</p>

<p>Wherever flows London stone the slits exist. A deep, dark
archway out of Surrey Street dives under the Norfolk Hotel;
follow it, go down Surrey Steps, and you shall come to a water-gate,
on which you may yet lean and smell the tar of Henry Fitz
Alwyn’s barge. Another slit, behind the Alexandra Hotel, will
lead you through Old Barrack Yard (I do not know what barrack)
and past low, industrial cottages, to the petrified splendours of
Belgravia. I wish I knew them all, for I discovered yet another
last week, after overlooking it for over sixteen years. It is called
St James’s Market, and leads off the Haymarket, towards the
neat elegancies of Jermyn Street. That does not sound promising;
yet, lost among the backs of warehouses and restaurants,
there stands a long, low house coated with <em>green</em> plaster; it
is a workshop, but some sense of fitness had bidden the
workers relieve its green walls with claret curtains. I
choose to be sure that in this house Axford tried to imprison
Hannah Lightfoot, until the fair Quakeress fled to her Georgian
lover.</p>

<p>And follow the green spot on the map, on the borough map,
that cares so much for the borough, so little for the town. The
borough map will lead you to green fields where flourish the
sardine tin and the wild hyacinth. It will lead you to a churchyard,
itself buried between theatres and shops, behind St Ann’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Soho, where King Theodore of Corsica has laid his insurgent
bones. It will lead you behind the solemnities of South Paddington
into the vast churchyard behind the little Chapel of the Ascension.
This is open to you all day; there you will find sparse graves,
vast lawns and, under the trees, friendly seats where you may
dream of death, or, if you prefer, of loves that will companion
you to that bourne.</p>

<span class="subhead">PLAYGROUNDS</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> is strange that the theatre should matter in a nation such as
ours, which has gained a reputation for liberalism and tolerance,
being tolerant because it cared for nothing, and liberal because it
understood little. The vogue of the theatre reflects the character
of urban England, which is as frivolous as that of urban Italy is
dour; because it is the symbol of pleasure, easily attained and
still more easily digested, it can always find room in the newspaper,
where the affairs of the nation flicker and the claims of art are
unmet. For let there be no confusion: art and the theatre are
not the same thing; almost one might say that if a play possesses
artistic quality it holds a passport to eternity, with this difference,
that many things lost in eternity are remembered. A little more
may be said of this further on.</p>

<p>London has always been a city of theatres, perhaps because
we have, for many centuries, laboured under the Puritan tradition:
its bitterness has attached to the theatre a glamour foreign to it in
hotter lands. When you open a book of memoirs by an Italian,
a German, or a Russian, you may be sure that it will consist in
portraits of politicians, biographies of cocottes, stories of riots
and coronations, but if at Hatchards you peer into any volume
called <i>My Life</i>, or something like that, you will almost invariably
discover that the greater part of the author’s life seems to have
been employed in meeting Sir Henry Irving, or waiting outside
the Adelphi on first nights. The theatre, you see, is wicked and
winning; the most august of the augustine, Messrs Coutts and
Co., stamp upon their cheques their old sign: ‘At the “Three
Crowns” in the Strand, next door to the Globe Theatre, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1692.’
I will wager those three crowns that no bank manager would
ever think of advertising on his cheques: ‘Next door to Westminster
Abbey.’ Why this should be is not entirely explained
by the Puritan tradition, and it is still less explained by the London
theatres themselves, nearly all of them, the meanest, dirtiest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
dingiest, fustiest, frowstiest edifices in the country. This is true,
whether you pass from Drury Lane, that cave of winds, to
‘behind,’ at the Kingsway, where the oldest rabbit would get
lost. Indeed, our theatres must have been influenced by the
Puritan tradition, for everything has been done to hide their
addresses in the papers, to make their doors invisible, their seating
suitable for a Christian martyr. There is not in London a pre-Boer
War theatre the pit of which is not summed up by Rutland
Barrington’s song: ‘You bark your shins, you bang your head,
your knees are up to your nose in bed ...’ and so on. They are
so arranged that people delicately place their feet in the small
of your back, so that nobody can enter the middle of a row without
disturbing it, or leave it without infuriating it; as for the rakes,
in spite of the matinée hat, I suspect that they have been planned
to encourage expensive transfers. Of course, the worst theatres
are those which are known as the ‘good old’ ones. There is no
such thing as good old. There is nothing but bad old, and the
theatre is an example. It must have been that heathen god, Good
Old, invented Covent Garden. Good Old got it up in red and
gold (Good Old would); Good Old planned the slips, which on one
side let you hear all the strings and on the other all the brass.
Good Old says it is cheap for half a crown. Good Old planned
Drury Lane and laid it down where no buses pass. And, no
doubt, Good Old handed over what was then Her Majesty’s
Theatre to Shakespeare as dramatised by Beerbohm Tree.</p>

<p>Some of the old London theatres, it is true, are a little less
repulsive because they are not quite so large. Thus, the Haymarket,
the Royalty, and in a queer, insidious way old Sadler’s
Wells. Sadler’s Wells has gone; there to-day upon the film
cowboys race and rescue, and negroid heroines register their
emotions, but not long ago it was one of the few pleasant places
Good Old had bequeathed us, with its hemicycle of plush-backed
stalls, its little boxes lined with an inch of lush and half an inch
of dirt, its heavy red hangings, favourable to lovers, its preposterous
plays of love, gold, faith, patriotism, and banana falls. You see,
at Sadler’s Wells, Good Old dated back to about 1780, while at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
most of our theatres he has brought himself up to date, say to 1860,
and has grown respectable; it has not agreed with him. When
we consider the few new theatres that have been built, such as
the Scala, the Little Theatre, the Ambassadors, we are sure
that the old cannot be brought up to date. Like most old institutions,
the English theatre can be reformed only by dynamite.</p>

<p>As in many human things, architecture is at fault. The
playhouse is evolved from the Roman circus. But the circus
offered a performance without scenery, which could be seen from
all sides. When scenery came, it grew impossible to show the
play except from one side, so as not to give away the mystery;
thus we obtained the semi-circular auditorium, which would be
quite satisfactory if it did not result in a perpetually partial view
for one half of the audience. The old play was mainly pantomimic;
when the play grew more articulate it became impossible to hear
the words very far, and as the theatre could not spread outwards
it spread upwards. Then chaos came, for rakes had to be so
arranged as to enable people to see, and yet packed close under
another tier. The result is sardines.</p>

<p>Indeed, when we consider what it labours against, it is remarkable
that the theatre should be so healthy. Every year, well over
half the plays that are put on enjoy less than six weeks’ run, and
if it were not notorious that bankruptcy is a profitable trade one
would wonder how managers live. The managers seem to have
done everything to achieve financial suicide. Especially during
the last twenty years; notably stimulated by Mr Charles Frohman
and Mr George Edwardes, they have indulged in an endless
competition in expensive staging. It grew quite common for a
play to cost £5000 to stage, and much more was spent sometimes.
Now, that large sum was risked, not invested, and so the unfortunate
manager had to pay his backers a heavy toll. I am sure he was
entirely wrong, for audiences prefer plays to scenery, and Mr
Cochran, one of the few managers who remembers that once
upon a time he was a public, has proved this by staging a successful
revue for about £150. Do not believe that I am a highbrow;
I do not suggest that <i>A Little Bit of Fluff</i> should be staged without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
scenery, but with curtains (though there is a lot in curtains, if
discreetly drawn), but I do suggest that the more elaborate the
scenery, the more the play is overlooked. Perhaps that is what
the managers desire, and judging from the condition of modern
drama, perhaps they are right. But I attribute to the managers
no such profundities of psychology. Rather would I say that
they know what the public wants, and one thing they know well:
the public wants certain actors and wants them passionately.</p>

<p>I shall never forget a certain performance of <i>King Henry V.</i>
There entered a man in silver armour, his visor down, and a
gasping female by my side said: ‘That’s Lewis Waller.’ And
the worst of it is that she was right, and that I knew she was right.
Visor or no visor, I too knew it was Lewis Waller; it was Lewis
Waller, slamming and banging British drama as none better
could than he, by insisting, in his silver armour, on being always
Waller, never Henry V. They are all like that: Mr Gerald
du Maurier may dress himself up as a policeman, or swathe his
neck in a choker, or get into evening clothes and pretend to be a
burglar, but thick over those artifices lies always the charming
du Maurier trail. He is loved for that, just as Beerbohm Tree
was loved for the confectionery of his voice and the circular
movement of his hand, as Mr Hawtrey is loved for his sober
cynicism, and Miss Doris Keane for ... I don’t know exactly
what. Whatever actors are loved for, it is always for being themselves
and never for being their parts; whether, like Miss Lilian
Braithwaite, they have cast themselves for the lilies and languors
of virtue, or, like Miss Dorothy Minto, for the roses and raptures
of vice, to those selections they must cleave, or they shall be loved
no more. But if they do cleave to these selves of theirs, then shall
they attain fame, and the public will not say: ‘Have you been to
<i>Hamlet</i>?’ but ‘Have you seen Martin Harvey?’ And this
worship shapes yet another stone to hurl at the English theatre,
namely, fantastic salaries, varying between £100 and £300 a week.
Call me a Bolshevik if you like, but I say no man is worth £300
a week; nobody knows this when the man is alive, but everybody
does the day after he is dead. This would not matter if it did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
not make the theatre so expensive to run, therefore the prices of
the seats so high that only those who can afford it sit in them.
The richer the staging, the poorer the play; the dearer the seat,
the greater its attraction to the people who know ‘the price of
everything and the value of nothing.’ For long purses are made
of sows’ ears.</p>

<p>I wonder if something could be done for the theatre.
Supposing it were built like the Scala, so that nobody sat at
the sides, so that everybody might see the play instead of
hats, so that one might have a fit in the stalls and be removed
without causing too much trouble (you see, I think of everything),
so that the people at the top were not seated so high as to observe
mainly the actors’ upper skulls. Supposing a theatre like the
Munich Kammerspiele, which holds five hundred, were to be
built. Supposing, like that one, it had but one balcony; supposing
it were cheap to light; supposing, too, that it had no programme
sellers, but delivered programmes at the doors from a penny-in-the-slot
machine; supposing it had no cloak-room attendants,
but hooks with a number and a padlock; supposing it had no ...
I forget the name of the attendant, something like pew-opener,
and that the seats were not numbered from A.26 to M.34 in the
stalls, not numbered at all in the pit, and re-numbered again in
the upper circle; supposing the seats were just numbered 1, 2,
3, so that one could find them; supposing we paid actors for
rehearsals and engaged them for a certain term; supposing all
this, would the public be pleased? I wonder! I wonder whether
the public would like paying less for its seats. If stalls did not
cost 10s. 6d., would it trust the play? It certainly does not trust
the doctor who charges less than 10s. 6d. And yet, once upon
a time, the theatre was cheap. When, sixty years ago, Ben
Webster was producing at the Adelphi, a stall cost 5s., and Mr
Webster offered amphitheatre stalls ‘with elbows and cushions,
secured the whole evening’ for 1s.</p>

<p>Yes, a good deal might be done like this. A good deal might
be done by the Lord Chamberlain and the London County Council,
if only they would cease to devote all their thoughts to exits from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the theatre. (On consideration, this may be well advised.) They
might allow smoking, and best of all, they might allow everything,
suspend all censorship, and be assured that the plays which are
called objectionable would not be staged. I do not mean that
there is no demand for objectionable plays; there is; indeed, we
nearly all of us like objectionable plays, but the Puritans can trust
our Puritan feeling, which makes it impossible for us to enjoy
objectionable plays because we dare not be seen enjoying them
by other people who are also enjoying them. Ah! if you could
go to the play masked it would be different.</p>

<p>What is wrong with the drama is that it does not hold an
idea to the square act; is it worth saving? For it may truly be
said that the only fault the public finds in a stupid play is that it
is not stupid enough. You do not believe me. Let us look at
the list of plays in to-day’s paper. To-day there are open thirty-six
metropolitan theatres, including some we can leave out,
Maskelyne’s, Drury Lane (Opera), the Philharmonic. Of the
remaining thirty-three, musical comedy occupies six stages. Say
no more about that. If it were not for the lips that sing, our
attention would be concentrated on English music. Revue rages
at five theatres. This leaves twenty-two plays running. Among
them are two spy plays, two comic war plays, a mystical melodrama,
four farces; the rest consists in plays made by hands unassisted
by heads, plays that the next generation may make by machinery.
The groans of old age are heard as Sir Arthur Pinero rigs <i>The
Freaks</i> upon their legs, as Mr Somerset Maugham presents <i>Love
in a Cottage</i>. And <i>Dear Brutus</i> is the twinkling star that makes
darker the Thalian night.</p>

<p>In hardly one of these plays is there a single moment of
intellectual distinction. I do not mean that I ask those twenty-two
stages to make up the night’s programme of <i>King Lear</i>,
<i>Ghosts</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Trois Filles de Monsieur Dupont</i>, the <i>Sunken Bell</i>, <i>The
Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>, but I do think that their coalition
might give us more than <i>Dear Brutus</i>. There should be plenty
of room for true comedy of the type of <i>The Admirable Crichton</i>,
<i>Mrs Gorringe’s Necklace</i>, <i>John Bull’s Other Island</i>, <i>The Cassilis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Engagement</i>, <i>Chains</i>, comedy with ideas. There should be room
for <i>The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnett</i>, <i>The Playboy of the Western
World</i> and other solid plays. But one condition is that we should
pay for plays, not players. We do not. If you want evidence
consider the following advertisement of <i>When Knights were Bold</i>
(a really amusing play):—</p>

<p class="p1 in0">Ten press quotations. Two refer to the play; one may refer to
play or to actor; seven refer to the actor only. (The playwright
is not mentioned, but never mind). This does not mean that the
newspapers confined their notices to Mr Bromley Challenor, but
it does mean that the management selected for quotation only
the phrases which refer to the actor, because that is what the
public wants, and what it gets for the hastening of its mental
decay.</p>

<p>What is wrong with the theatre is, to a certain extent, right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
with the music-hall, and this for two reasons: we have to deal
with a different kind of playgoer, and the excessive valuation of the
actor is sharply limited by the worth of his songs. I have seen
Ernie Mayne, Ella Shields, and others rouse the house with one
song and half-fail with another. The theatre-goer, who, on the
whole, is not a music-hall-goer, is usually either in a smug condition,
or over-conscious of his digestive process. Nearly all the pit
and upper circle, and the bulk of the dress circle, feel that they
are indulging in a respectable spree. Leaving aside the one who,
in the newspapers, signs his letters as ‘Old Playgoer’ (generally
an old fool), or ‘Old Firstnighter,’ probably an old lunatic (because
the first night is the worst night), the cheaper seats in a theatre
are tenanted mainly by people in a stupefied state of admiration.
They have escaped for a few hours from the dug-outs of respectability;
their families have not long emerged from the tradition
that the theatre is a place of evil repute; some even believe that
they are improving their minds, which is touching, whatever the
condition of their minds. They file their programmes. They
loudly proclaim to their friends that they ‘ought’ to go and see
such and such a play. Perhaps they go because they ought to.
Perhaps they go to dream dreams; no doubt nightmares do not
disappoint them. The stalls are not in search of virtue tempered
with a little vice; most of their patrons are confessedly in search
of vice neat. They never get it. And if this vice, invisible to
anybody who is not a bishop or the editor of a Sunday paper, is
necessary to their health, it is because they visit the theatre in a
state of advanced repletion, because they are people who manage
to be replete in the middle of a European war; such is their
nature. No wonder, then, that the cold suet of the drama should
have so securely become wrapped in the wet dish-cloth of the
playgoer. Thus, it may be true to say that the playgoer gets the
plays he deserves. The music-hall-goer is different.</p>

<p>If it is true that many go to the theatre when they have eaten
too much, it is, to a certain extent, true that many go to the music-hall
when they have drunk too much, which, if I must choose,
is less repulsive. They are frankly out for a rag; they want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
laugh, and I had rather they guffawed than drowsed. You can’t
drowse in a music-hall: from the moment when the conductor,
in his elaborately luxurious and irremediably faulty dress suit,
addresses his first and infinitely disabused bow to the audience,
to the time when he calls upon the band to produce the smallest
possible scrap of ‘God Save the King,’ and hurries out loyalty
on the wings of ragtime, there is no flagging. It is not only that
red-nosed comedian and eccentric comedienne, American dancer,
or sketch got up regardless, tread upon each other’s heels; the
main thing is the band, the harsh, rapid band, that never stops,
that plays anything, providing it is the thing of the day, with all
the regularity and indifference of the typewriter. From it gush
patriotism, comedy or sentiment, and all three burst forth with
their full headline value. There is no tickling of big drums;
when the drum is banged you know it; nor is there measure in
the sigh of the oboe, for the music-hall paints not in wash-greens
and grays; scarlet, black, white, and electric-blue are
its gamut.</p>

<p>Nothing else would satisfy the audience that every music-hall
comedian must encounter every night. It is a mixed audience.
There are old stagers who sit in the same seat every Saturday
night, without looking at the programme, and this differentiates
them from the playgoer: they are bound for a playground. There
are the discriminating who follow the star, so long as the star’s
songs refrain from appealing to what is described as their better
feelings; there are the very young in search of excitement, and
determined to get it; there are the slightly older, who come in
pairs, and do nothing to conceal the fact. (Of late years, many
of these have been lost to the music-halls and have taken to the
cinemas because they are darker.) But one thing unites them
all: they have come here to be amused, amused at once, amused
all the time; they are not ready to make allowances; if an old
song is a good song, it is a good song, but if it is not a good song
the seasoned music-hall-goer will know it at once. I have heard
him turn to his neighbour and say: ‘It’s all up. She won’t get
across.’ Getting across the footlights is not, in a music-hall, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
same thing as getting across in a theatre. The music-hall performer
has no scenery to help him, in this sense, that the properties
are well known to the audience. I have seen at least twenty turns
at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire in front of a drop-curtain which
I swear is Croydon High Street. The words of the song are, as
a rule, difficult to sing. Often, as in the case of George Robey,
the costume is stereotyped and never varies. Thus the music-hall
performer, having not the scenery of Harry Hope, or the
knee-breeches of Malvolio, can rely on nothing but himself. He
comes naked into an entirely cold world. His situation is ideally
expressed by the old cartoon of the impresario, his foot bound up
to show that he has gout. Before him stands the dingy figure of
a little performer. This is their <span class="locked">dialogue:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Impresario</i>: ‘What’s your line?’</p>

<p><i>Performer</i>: ‘Comedian.’</p>

<p><i>Impresario</i>: ‘Well! get on with it! Make me laugh.’</p></blockquote>

<p>If within one minute of his appearance the performer has not
got his laugh he will probably not get it at all. If he is famous,
and if his turn is not too bad, nothing worse will happen than the
administration of the frozen lemon. It is rather tragic, feeling
the lemon come. You feel the audience leap up towards the
performer, for it is always ready to give him his chance, even if
he is unknown; then, in a minute or so, you feel the audience
drop away from him; you are aware that he is not being listened
to, for people begin to talk, to flutter with their programmes, and
perhaps some one may hum an irrelevant air. The wretched
performer knows it. If you are sitting in the first row of the
stalls you see anxiety come over his face. He begins to shout or
to dance rather wildly; he knows that he is not getting across;
he tries to attract attention as a cockatoo if he cannot do so as an
eagle. Then some one laughs derisively, and there is something
hideous in that laughter; it makes one think of the thumb-down
attitude in the Roman circus. The curtain drops in the middle
of something that is half hum and half silence. That is the lemon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
It is only in extreme cases that the audience manifests disapproval.
Indeed, it is an audience full of good-natured contempt,
and if the lemon is taken it willingly passes on to the next turn;
as a rule, the lemon is taken by the management, who ring down
the curtain on the first song and do not let the performer come
on again. But if the performer does come on again, and strives
to recapture lost ground, the audience will give him thirty seconds
to do it; if he fails, the hum grows angry as that of a swarm of
bees. There is more derisive laughter; a few yells come from
the gallery; a general uproar develops from the hum. You
discern cries: ‘I want to go ’ome’.... ‘Take me back to mother.’ ...
Opponents reply as loudly: ‘Shut up! chuck him out!’
But the voices resume in more and more sepulchral tones: ‘I
want to go ’ome,’ while others join the rag for the rag’s sake, and
some stentor high above roars: ‘Shut yer face, dear, I see yer
Christmas dinner.’ And then everybody cries: ‘Chuck him out!’
while the performer sings louder and louder, and the band makes
still more desperate efforts to drown his song. Then a large portion
of the audience rise to their feet and bellow enmity until the
curtain goes down. That is the scarlet bird, and I have not often
seen it on the wing.</p>

<p>No, there is no mercy in the music-hall audience. For it is an
honest audience, and is, therefore, capable of every brutality.
Also, everybody has paid for his seat. Nobody there can afford
to waste that small payment. They must get their money’s
worth. They know exactly what they want; they have
been wanting it ever since the Middle Ages, and, on the whole,
have been getting it. They want rough and obvious jokes told
in a subtle and intelligent way; they want to see the performer
break plates or sit on the butter, but he must do it in a debonair
style; they want songs of which they know the tune by the time
the second couplet is reached, favourite songs of which they can
bellow the choruses while the triumphant performer whispers it;
above all, they want their traditional jokes. Cheese, lodgers,
mothers-in-law, twins, meeting the missus at 3 a.m., alcoholic
excess, one or more of these must be introduced to make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
successful song. It does not matter who you are, whether the great
McDermott, Dan Leno, or R. G. Knowles, you must tie your
little bark to the great ship of the English music-hall tradition.
No famous song has become famous unless a portion of it at
least dealt with one of these subjects: ‘Champagne Charlie,’
‘I’m following in father’s footsteps,’ ‘The Girl, the Woman, and
the Widow,’ are clear evidences of this. Perhaps that is why
some delicate artists, such as Maidie Scott and Wish Wynne,
have never quite ‘got there.’ Maidie Scott is the most finished
product on the music-halls of to-day. As soon as she comes on,
her quick, schoolgirl walk, her red hair, her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">distrait</i> eyes, and the
voice which she knows so amazingly how to keep down to a minor
key, cut her right out of the stage. When Maidie Scott sings
‘Amen,’ or ‘Father’s got the sack from the water-works’ (all
along of his cherry briar pipe, because they were afraid he’d set
the water-works on fire), and still more when she sings, ‘I’m
glad I took my mother’s advice,’ one has a sense of extraordinary
detachment. She is aloof, alone. She is so entirely under restraint;
knows so well how, at last, to let her voice swell and underline
her point; she knows so well how not to waste during a song the
power of her splendid blue eyes, but to reserve them for that final
point. Thus she should wield astonishing power, yet does not
quite; she lacks grossness; like Wish Wynne, her art is a little
too delicate to get across. The audience like her, they like Wish
Wynne singing ‘Oo! er!’ and miserably dragging her little
tin trunk, but never for either do they rise and roar as they do for
Marie Lloyd.</p>

<p>It is true that Marie Lloyd takes us into another world, that of
the comfortable public-house, with plenty of lights and red plush;
to the publican’s dog-cart off to the Derby; to the large birthday
party, enlivened by plenty of sherry wine. In Marie Lloyd’s
world everything is fat, healthy, round, jolly, bouncing; when
she keeps the old man’s trousers to remember him by after he’s
gone, she defines the human quality of her sentiment: she can
do nothing false and artificial, such as pressing his nuptial buttonhole.
Marie Lloyd is a woman before she is an actress, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
this lies her strength. When she advises the audience to ‘’Ave
a little bit of what yer fancy (if you fancy it, if you fancy it), ’Ave a
little bit of what yer fancy, I say it does yer good,’ Marie Lloyd
is expressing the eternal claim of the flesh against the spirit, which
has been rediscovered a great many times since Epicurus. She
survives a great generation; there is nobody to-day fit to wear
her pleasantly-little shoes.</p>

<p>There is nobody, because the spirit of the music-hall is
changing, and women, who are more adaptable than men, are
feeling it first. An awful thing is happening to most of the young
women on the halls; they are becoming refined. Louie and
Toots Pounds, Ella Retford, Clarice Mayne, Ella Shields, have
nothing of the Marie Lloyd tradition; they are almost creatures
of the drawing-room. Even Beattie and Babs, though Babs
does what she can with stockings that nothing will ever keep up,
never seem to experience the thick joy of being alive that Marie
Lloyd conveys in one slow, sidelong raising of her immortal
eyelid. There is, perhaps, a white hope, Daisy Wood, but one
cannot be sure. They sing well, these young women, they dance
well; they do it too well; women of the older tradition, such as
Victoria Monks and Nellie Wallace are still themselves: they
do not do it so well, but they do it. These are not trained, like
the young women, but they have grown up and discovered themselves;
they do not <em>act</em> joy or distress: they cut joy or distress
out of common life and lay it down on the bare planks. All that
is going, for the music-hall is growing refined.</p>

<p>Let me dispel a possible misunderstanding. When I say
music-hall I do not mean those sinks of virtue, the Coliseum, or
the Palladium, the Palace, and the Hippodrome. Those are royal
theatres of varieties, eminently suited for long skirts and acrobats,
and large enough for elephants. Two of them can safely be
handed over to revue, and the rest is silence. I have seen Mr
George Robey, I forget whether it was at the Palladium or the
Coliseum, and the place was so broad, and so deep, and so high,
that his eyebrows looked normal: can I add anything to the horror
of this picture? The only comedian who ever seemed to me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
success in those barns was Little Tich, as little Miss Turpentine,
because they made him still smaller, which heightened his effect.
But those halls pay large salaries, and I suppose they will go on.
Indeed, I fear that they are gaining ground because we are daily
sinking deeper in the Joseph Lyons civilisation, where everything
must be cheap, gilt, and enormous. The old halls, the Holborn,
the Metropolitan, the Bedford, Collins’s, will not last long;
already many halls have been seized, the Tivoli and the Canterbury
by cinemas, the Shepherd’s Bush, I think the Paragon, Mile End, and
certainly the Shoreditch Empire by Sir Oswald Stoll. We have to
count with Sir Oswald Stoll. Together with Sir Joseph Lyons, he has
done more to drive out Merrie England than the dourest champion
of methodism. You can go to his music-halls, or to the
Palladium, which is not a Stoll hall, but a stollomorphe, and nothing
will offend your good taste. During the last dozen years Sir Oswald
Stoll has been engaged in a continuous and painfully successful
campaign to raise the English music-hall; he has almost succeeded
in elevating it. True, in his halls appear all those men who carry
on the old tradition and glorify the flesh: George Robey, Sam
Stern, Ernie Mayne, Sam Mayo, who sing the crude joy of
poor life, which is found in drunken sprees and conjugal misunderstandings,
but which yet is true life. Little by little their
songs grow less broad. Sam Mayo would not, at a Stoll hall,
sing the ditty which used to delight the old Middlesex: ‘Ching
Chang, wing wang, bing, bang, boo,’ nor would Dutch Daly
sing about the larks in May. Our old comedians are limiting
their humours, discolouring their noses, rolling their umbrellas.
The young ladies in the audience, and their young gentlemen,
modern forms of the donah and her bloke, would feel uncomfortable
if too crudely reminded that love is something more than
kisses on Brighton Pier under a pale pink sunshade. The old
comedians are not yet dead, and Ernie Mayne can still <span class="locked">sing:—</span></p>

<p>Yes, Ernie Mayne may still sing his songs of Araby, but
little by little he is being borne down by the American raconteur,
whose impropriety is always in the best of taste, by the ragtime
dancer, by the wandering Italian fiddler, by the respectable
eccentric at the piano, by the juggler, by the refined soprano,
who sings ‘God send you back to me, over the mighty sea,’ or,
‘There’s a little mother always yearning for the ones that long
to roam.’ It’s all getting so clean, so precious pure. The old
comedian will not last long. He that was once a bull in a china-shop
will soon become a Stolled ox.</p>

<p>But the worst may yet have to come. A new demon is arising
in the shape of the cinema. It is as if Merrie England, that once
lived at the Surrey Theatre and the Globe, and was driven out
when the middle class began to frequent the theatre about 1870
and took refuge in the caves of harmony, then doubled back into
the Tivoli and the Oxford (fortunately to provide what the late
W. T. Stead called ‘drivel for the dregs’), were being pursued.
Wherever Merrie England goes, it seems that, as Mark Sheridan
used to put it, ‘the villain thtill purthued her, purthued her,
purthued her.’ When the music-hall has been completely improved
I wonder whether he will be glad to have ‘purthued her’ to such
good purpose. Certainly, in the cinemas, little is left of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
spirit that arose as one drank one’s beer in the stalls at the old
Mogul, for the cinema, let police magistrates say what they like,
bears deep upon its brow the brand of Abel.</p>

<p>The cinema, like most new and virile things, has split opinion,
and has collected round itself more unwise friends and unthinking
enemies than any other form of entertainment. Few people like
cinemas; they either love them or loathe them, while a few, I
suppose, fall into my section of feeling and hate them for not
being better than they are. For I believe in the cinema; I do not
think that the cinema will do away with the theatre and the novel,
but I do believe that it is destined to play a still larger part in the
amusement of the people. Also, I believe that it is destined to
play a cleaner, that is, a more artistic part. How far it can be
brought, I do not know, because I do not suppose that I am the
one chosen by nature to raise it high; but if we consider films
such as <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>, or <i>Intolerance</i>, where Mr D. W.
Griffith, a man of some slight culture, is not entirely devoid of
taste, and certainly bold in his conceptions, audacious in his
execution, we cannot wave the cinema away with a sneer at cowboy
drama.</p>

<p>The cinema began with cowboy drama, with silly pursuits on
horseback, by motor-car and by train, but that was only because,
for the first time, movement could be reproduced. The reproduction
of movement was a new pleasure, and so the mob
clamoured for it. Carry yourself back to your first film and, be
you as highbrowed as you like, you will not deny that you enjoyed
those febrile races, those people falling out of windows, crashing
through ceilings, the violent opening and shutting of doors, the
rush of flying crockery. Then you grew tired of it and began to
think it silly. Well, it was silly, and it is silly, but we should
remember that the pioneers of the cinema were Americans of the
travelling-showman type, men whose fathers had exhibited the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">camera obscura</i> loved of our fathers; they had passed through
dissolving views, and that type of man could not be expected
to like, and therefore to put forward, a dramatic version of <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. Briefly, the cinema was put forward by the vulgar, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
vulgar, but by degrees, as the mob grew weary of movement for
movement’s sake, as the profits increased, new men such as Pathé,
Urban, Gaumont, came in. They were commercial men, but
not vulgar men, men who realised that if there was a public for
the novels of Mr E. F. Benson and the plays of Mr Alfred Sutro,
there must be a cinema public for something less lurid than the
early films. By degrees, the cinema improved; it improved in
conceptions when subjects such as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quo Vadis?</i>, <i>The Walls of
Jericho</i>, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Bella Donna</i>, appeared on the film; yet more ambitious
things were done in the shape of <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, <i>Justice</i>,
<i>Intolerance</i>, and many more.</p>

<p>The film improved, too, in its actual execution. The earliest
type of film actor was scraped up from the East Side gutters of
New York and the graving-docks of Naples. For that early
cinema you needed creatures immensely unrestrained, yelling,
dancing, dirty creatures, not at all the people who could have
impersonated what the old lady in the pit called the ‘married life
of the dear Queen.’ And as the subjects changed the actors
changed; many were taken from the stage; some, to this day,
preserve certain characteristics of the ordinary human being.
It is not quite their fault if they do not preserve them all; the
cinema has had time to make a tradition of its own, which is still
represented by the American posters we see upon the walls,
where the heroines have enormous eyes and more teeth than Lulu
Dentifrice; where the young men have straight backs to their
heads, half a pound of white meat on each cheek, a rugged brow,
or an emetic grin, briefly, the most brutal type of Chicago commercial
rigged out in the dress clothes of a suicide; where ladies
whose clothing is too low for blouses and too high for evening
frocks, whose jewels flash beyond the dreams of Gophir, quaff
the sparkling champagne wine. Where the illustrator manages
to make Miss Irene Vanbrugh look vulgar. Where American
policemen (or admirals, you never know) arrest crooks in mid-air;
where all is six-shooters, bowie-knives, cinches, and snarks. Like
poster like player, is, to a certain extent, true, for the producer is
still a cross between Pimple and the sort of stockbroker whose silk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
hat glitters in eight places. (Observe the band on his cigar.)
But that producer, like that poster, is the old tradition, and is
giving way before the ordinary business man who does not see
the world in terms of banana falls. That new man is not pressing
his actors as the old producer did. He still makes them register,
but less intensely. Register means to mark the emotions. When
the hero is being filmed, and the heroine enters, he smiles; if he
does not smile beatifically enough the producer will cry to him:
‘Register delight!’ You have all seen the result. In the old days
they were registering all the time; you could see the heroine
registering terror, while the hero registered nobility, and the
villain registered hate; meanwhile, the old mother dropped a
stitch and registered benevolence with extreme pertinacity, and,
all the time, servants in the background were registering national
pride and rectitude. One still has to do these things on the cinema
because, after all, the cinema picture has to be photographable.
It has to be seen rather plainly, but the cinema producer has
begun to understand that, to be effective, facial expression need
not be recognisable a mile away.</p>

<p>It is the excessive vigour of the cinema has endeared it to
Londoners; most of them are a rather lymphatic crowd, because
they live in too large a city, surrounded by too many interesting
things, because they eat rather bad food and not enough of it,
and also because most of them work in stuffy offices and factories.
Thus they need strong stimuli if they are to react, and no
doubt that is why cinemas are being established one by the side
of the other, and run for ten hours a day. Like the sensational
stories in the magazines, like the newspapers which consist in
much headline and little text, they spur this tired creature. The
more he is spurred, the more tired he grows. The more tired he
grows, the more he needs spurring. So the cinema must prosper.
But I think it will prosper in a more moderate way; it will continue
to grow, to absorb theatres and music-halls; it has already
absorbed the Coronet, the Canterbury, Sadler’s Wells, the Tivoli,
the Scala, the London Opera House, and others; but I think it
will more and more tend to produce the historical film, films based<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
on novels and plays of some slight merit; that it will increasingly
provide bearable music. For a while it may not originate much,
and therefore it will not easily become a form of art. I am not
sure that it can become a form of art, though I do not know why:
the ballet is a form of art, and people like Nijinsky, Pavlova,
Madame Rambert (let alone Taglioni and Genée) have made a
great deal of it. I do not say that it is impossible for the cinema
to produce a work of art, but this must be within the limits of
pantomime, which are close and narrow limits. Subtle emotions
it cannot express, for pantomime cannot figure that ‘she thought
this, because she thought that he thought that.’ (If a cinema
company will film <i>The Golden Bowl</i>, I will burn seven candles as an
offering to the Albert Memorial.) All that, the cinema must leave
to the play and the novel. It cannot risk wearying the audience
by leaving it for half an hour before the same scene; the theatre
can do that because the voices of the actors afford relief; the
cinema, being unable to reproduce footsteps, is compelled to
reproduce flying feet. Because it cannot speak, it must move,
and so it is a different kind of thing.</p>

<p>That does not mean that it need always be the rather crude
thing it is to-day. As people of better taste come into the business,
we are likely to do away with a few of the continual changes of
scene; we shall reduce repetitions, such as the woman who endlessly
rocks the baby’s cradle between every tragic scene in
<i>Intolerance</i>. Repetition is the way in which a crude taste rams its
point home; a fine taste will select its points better, need to make
them less obvious, know how to vary them. The selective art of
the novelist can thus be applied. Also, the finer taste will not
corrupt the actor as hitherto he has been corrupted, by leading
him into a wilderness of monkeys. The cinema will learn restraint,
that first need of all art. Some of the actors, such as Norma
Talmadge, Pauline Frederick, Mary Pickford, and especially
Charlie Chaplin, have already evolved a new form of acting, and
not a mean one. When Charlie Chaplin runs along a road, in
that queer, lolloping way which starts from the shoulders and
animates his fingers and his elbows, chasing a Rolls-Royce that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
obviously travelling at a hundred and twenty miles an hour,
when thereupon he falls into a ditch, and extricates himself with
an air of incredulity, when he then appears to realise, with a
detachment that none but Plato could have equalled, that he is
not likely to catch that car, and decides to go home, Charlie Chaplin
does a wonderful thing: he turns his back on the audience, and
you know, from a little ripple in his back that he is considering
the situation. Then the head gives a jerk, one of the shoulders
goes up, the fingers give a twist, and long before Charlie Chaplin
turns round to face the audience, with his soft eyes laughing,
his animate body has told you what he meant: ‘It’s gone. Oh,
well, I don’t care.’ The popularity of others may wane, but
Charlie Chaplin is a monument. As in the case of the music-halls,
a merciless audience has formed, and its love has readily
been given to the best.</p>

<h2 class="chapheadleft">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FRIENDLY BOWL</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Hard</span> things are said of the London public-house. It is dirty;
it is dingy; there is nothing to sit on; there is nothing to read;
it possesses neither intellect nor domino set; it is not a place
where a man can take his wife and family; it should be improved,
it should be suppressed (subtle distinction), and so on. The
curious side of these assaults is that the people who rave at the
public-house are not the people one sees in it, and one wonders
whether they passionately desire public-houses after their own
heart, and, presumably, for their own use. I have visions of the
public-house of their dreams, æsthetic and antiseptic, furnished,
according to persuasion, with Fabian tracts, or tracts of greater
orthodoxy. I imagine a staid crowd in that reformed public-house,
let us say, the Reverend Dr Horton and party, quaffing
the foaming cider-cup and discussing the principles of reconstruction;
Mr Sidney Webb and Mr Bernard Shaw passionately
engaged at spillikins ... and the working man in the modest
background.</p>

<p>The idea has little attraction, because, frankly, I like the
London public-house, just as I like the Paris café and the German
beer-hall. I do not see why we should make our public-houses
into Parisian cafés, for our needs differ from those of Parisians,
and we do not, among other things, visit public-houses to play
dominoes or to read <i>The Spectator</i>. Men go to public-houses to
drink, either because they are thirsty, or because they like drink.
Notably, the working man goes there to be rid of that wife and
family of which he sees quite enough. I know it is difficult for
the well-to-do man, whose house contains ten rooms, who has
a private room at his office, and a sulking chair at his club, to
understand that the working man, who generally lives in two
rooms with several children and the scented memory of many
meals, should want to escape this felicitous atmosphere. It may
also strike him as strange that the working man should not, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
a ten-hour day, relish ‘a good, brisk walk.’ Also, he does not
realise that ours is not yet a kid-glove civilisation, and that most
of our working people like the sensual life. Being Anglo-Saxons,
they are largely impervious to art, and rather crude in love; so
their sensuality finds an outlet in drink. You may deplore this
sensuality, but it is no use trying to stem it by making distasteful
the conditions under which it is indulged; the way to stem it is
to make a change in the creature, by treating it as a man, by
paying it as a citizen, and by granting it justice instead of favour,
education instead of teaching.</p>

<p>A new English people will make a new public-house; to-day,
they have the public-house they deserve, and it is not such an
evil place as some like to make out. Pellucid reader, have you
ever visited The Green Man? The Red Lion? or The Bedford
Head? Do you know the brew of The Warrington and The
Horseshoe’s chop? I like their busy bars, so cunningly
stratified into public bar, private bar, and saloon. They are a
microcosm of English society, where everybody keeps himself to
himself, where every class is defiled by every other class because
the one beneath is ‘low,’ and the one above ‘stuck up.’ In
England, classes barely establish internal toleration. There are
few equals inside classes. One either looks up or looks down,
and one never looks at. But in public-houses a rude toleration
does exist. They are not unattractive, for rough friendship is
included by every barmaid in the ‘gin and peach.’ One talks to
people one does not know. If one stays, one may hear the history
of their life. Nor are all public-houses ugly; there is a Dickensian,
a Jacobean charm in the dazzle of their many glasses, in their
piling bottles, their ash-trays presented by the brewer, their
match-stands, a gift from the distiller, in the portraits of
horses and dogs that proclaim the virtues of Johnny Walker,
and Black and White. Æsthetically speaking, these articles
are ugly, but they have a certain joviality which is not disagreeable.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that public-houses are all alike. No
two places are alike; not even Lyons’s depots are all alike, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the personality of the manageress reveals itself, say in strange
arrangements of salt-cellars. The casual visitor may not find
much difference between The Red Lion in the Harrow Road,
The Hero of Maida, Bricklayers’ Arms, or The Archway, and I
will not stress it. But it would need a more than casual observer
to overlook the spacious cleanliness of The Warrington, and its
rather Victorian air of solid comfort; should he go to Rule’s, or
The Cheshire Cheese, he will be obsessed by the domestic fustiness
of places that have escaped renovation for a century. Those
old taverns reveal a London little older than fifty years, when no
Ritz-Carltons were open, when the young man could join no
club until he was a middle-aged one, and when he ate his meals
in his rooms in Bury Street off soiled mahogany. These old
places are traditional, and their ale is traditional. I suspect that
it is a secret blend of old ale and new ale, the new being poured
into the old casks, thus ever inheriting and ever bequeathing the
virtues of the family.</p>

<p>And other inns have their temperament, which is that of
their customers. Thus, at the public-houses of London
Wall, as also at Coates’s Wine Bar, you never get away from the
sense of business. These places are friendly, but wary. Likewise,
at The Cock, in Fleet Street, there is more noise and less wariness,
because here is an exchange for news, and occasionally for facts;
farther on, at Shirreff’s, the attraction is sound wine under sound
arches. Shirreff’s clientèle numbers rather obese people who
know how to treat a glass of port. Thus should you treat a glass
of port: let the glass be not quite full, so that the holy wine may
have space in which to unwind its lovely surface; raise the glass,
holding its stem so that the fingers may not break the amber oval
of its form; then raise it to the level of the eyes, so that the pale light
of the city may stream through that rich amber, and emerge
transfigured; draw closer; respectfully breathe in the soft,
insidious scent that rises to your nostrils like a prayer. Then
only, when the golden ghost has spoken to all senses save that of
taste, drink, and drink slowly, without haste, with respect, not as
a vulgar man, thirsty, but as a man without thirst, and risen over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
such necessity. Thus only shall you be companions of Amarante,
Miranda, and Sabor.</p>

<p>If all drank with such elegance we might hear less of public-house
reform. Of late years, attempts have been made to humanise
the public-house; the first result has been to make it inhuman.
I lead no attack upon the Public-House Trust and the People’s
Refreshment House Association. They are excellent bodies, and
once upon a time I supported them, but as I grow older, I think
I grow more depraved. I know it is not pleasant to see people
drunk, though some are still more unpleasant when they are
sober; I do not support the public-house in selling last week’s
sandwiches and last year’s cheddar, but still ... ale that hath
no sting ... and leadless glaze! Instinct wars with my reason; I
see the public-houses grow more civilised, and a faint regret
creeps over me that good intentions should get into beer.</p>

<p>It is true that at the other end of the scale luxury fights with
good intentions and produces, well, not the abomination of
desolation, but the greater abomination of delectation in the
shape of the American bar. Already a young civilisation has
produced its first-fruits, such as broncho busting, college yells,
and cinema rides; already poets quaff from the foaming soda-fountain
in Hippocrene City, Pa. (or possibly Minn.), and in the
friendly bowl mix the cocktail. Magic word, eloquent in form!
I cannot express what I owe to the cocktail: it provides half of
what a dinner party needs, for it stimulates conversation. The
other half is provided by bridge, for it stops this conversation.
The power of the cocktail is not that of the pure in heart; it is a
complex, a modern; it is a congress of alcohols; nothing is alien
to it; nothing can hallow it; nothing can resist its repeated
assaults. With all drinks it has affinity. It carries the bar sinister
of all liqueurs. Bitters and curaçao, whisky and maraschino,
brandy, vermouth and cassis, Fernet Branca, gentle raspberry,
all of these; and crème de menthe, and gin, and absinthe, and
apple-jack, these, too, are of its fiery soul, and apricot brandy
that is like a blush, sherry like a burnt topaz, paprika to make
you leap, and sly benedictine, dancing anisette, and port like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
minor canon, gins from Plymouth, and Schiedam, virginal
grenadine, all can join with all the fruits the world has ever known,
cherry, lemon, tangerine, olive, spray of tarragon too. And thus one
begins a cocktail. Let your basis be gin; enlist vermouth; let
bitter and maraschino creep in: behold Martini! But expel the
vermouth to substitute apricot brandy: then you have Hungarian.
But if for you gin has no fire, then let your mainstay be rye whisky:
its allies, bitter and vermouth, and Manhattan for you appears.
And others for you shall rise, soda cocktail and love tree, or silver
fizz, or blagden punch ... or hot apple toddy. Treat not the
cocktail rudely. Let all coalitions be gradual, and temper their
fire with ground ice; then cast the whole in the silver mixer and
shake, shake, shake. While you shake, meditate.</p>

<p>In English bars they neither shake nor meditate; they drink
too uncritically the expression of the brewer’s artistic temperament,
and give forth too little of their own. But, still, they are pleasant
enough, these bars, whether British, as the gloomily popular
Leicester Lounge, or foreign as the Monico. They have
all the well-bred indifference of the Englishman who asks
you no questions because he seeks no answers, who makes
no comments because he has nothing to say. You need, you pay,
you are satisfied, you go. There is no revelry. For true revelry,
the glass that sparkles and the jug that foams, you must go to
some club at least a hundred years old, and in St James’s Street or
Pall Mall, where ‘old man’ and ‘old thing’ know each other’s
record and capacity, where, under an ancient roof, the prairie
oyster revives the spirits that flagged in the Row. Watch the
bow windows of some ancient club, and, while still holding that
good wine needs no bush, confess that good wine gets it.</p>

<h2 class="chapheadleft">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">WANDERERS</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Alphonse Daudet</span>, when analysing Tartarin de Tarascon, found
in him two Tartarins, Tartarin Quixote and Tartarin Sancho.
Tartarin Quixote liked fighting, adventure, uncertainty, blood,
knives, unscalable peaks, tornadoes at sea. Tartarin Sancho
liked flannel vests, long drinks of lemonade on a hot day, chocolate
in bed in the morning. No doubt, Tartarin Quixote and Tartarin
Sancho live in many of us, and certainly I confess to desperate
moods which, on the whole, I restrain, and to self-indulgent
moods which, on the whole, I encourage; but when we consider
men we know, it is curious how much more strongly Tartarin
Sancho or Tartarin Quixote is developed in them. Tartarin
Sancho leads the majority of mankind, that majority which is
always looking for a good billet, for a pension, for a nice little
wife, a cat, and a garden. Some, more ambitious, substitute for
the nice little wife a woman of title, for the cat a hunter, for the
garden an estate, but their desires, after all, are still those of
Sancho, even though they are those of Sancho become Governor
of Barataria. Naturally they adopt the wadded life. It is not a
crime, and no doubt many of the Tartarin Quixotes, who number
among them tight-rope dancers, mining magnates, card-sharpers,
and cabinet ministers, often come to regret the bed quilt of a
blameless life. Only the bed quilt is not for them.</p>

<p>Somehow, I don’t know why, I cannot help feeling that
Tartarin Sancho is less normal than Tartarin Quixote. He does
such strange things; he enlists in a bank, grinds out his little
span of life and dies; or he becomes a barrister, pleads cases he
believes in, and also others; or Tartarin Sancho turns into a
respectable stockbroker, that is to say, he never speculates, but
induces other people to gamble; or he becomes a professional
soldier, and passes the first half of his life hoping there will be
a war; if there is none, then he passes the other half in the rather
more decayed parts of Earl’s Court. These are queer trades, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
they do not seem to satisfy anything that man needs if he is to
feel complete. It is not enough that a man should, by the time he
dies, have manufactured, let us say, large quantities of office
furniture, have played golf, have gone to Eastbourne or Monte
Carlo, have met the one girl whom he wrongly imagined to be
the only girl in the world, ignoring the fact that there are thousands
like her, have reproduced the species and left them behind to do
likewise. ‘Such is life,’ says my old friend the housekeeper of
Wellington Buildings, Bethnal Green; she is right, but somehow
this explanation does not satisfy me, and I wonder whether all
those respectable, clean-living people are not really degenerates,
in so far as they have lost the desire for colour in life. It may be
that Tartarin Quixote does not desire colour in life, and that
he would gladly exchange the pebbly bed of romance for the
eiderdown of the regular life; still, what a man does matters, as
well as what a man desires. It is all very well praising the mute,
inglorious Milton in the factory or the shop, but the Milton who
manages to break the silence is also important in the scheme.
The idea is greater than the fact, but to deny the fact would be to
run Plato too far.</p>

<p>Therein lies the charm of the queer people, in whom London
is rich, people who follow unexpected occupations, occupations
that nobody would naturally think of following. One can understand
how Mrs Smith comes to hear from one of her husband’s
friends that they want an apprentice in the printing shop; she
sends little Tommy to the printing shop, and he becomes a printer.
But how does little Paolo become an ice-cream man? There are
lots of ice-cream men, and so we must believe that some impulse
directed young Paolo towards ice-cream. How did it happen?
Was it a vocation, this selling of ice-cream? Did he discover an
ice-cream opening? I don’t know; I once asked an ice-cream
merchant why he sold ice-cream. He told me that he did it
because his father did it. Then I asked him why his father sold
ice-cream. He told me that his father sold ice-cream because his
grandfather sold ice-cream. Then I saw that we might go on
for a long time like this, and let him alone, for the ice-cream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
merchant was growing suspicious. I am glad that I do not
know whether his grandfather sold ice-cream because his great-grandfather
sold ice-cream, for this leaves a little to my imagination,
and I am able to imagine that in the misty cinquecento, some
adventurous Florentine, some relative of Benvenuto Cellini, was
impelled to forsake a hospitable guild to push about the European
tracks the gay little carriage that to-day bears the Italian flag,
diplomatically intertwined with the flag of the country in which
the merchant happens to trade, the portrait of King Victor, and,
on the other side, some touching scene such as ‘Mother’s Last
Kiss.’</p>

<p>The ice-cream man sets out every day on adventure. He
may have a beat, but I prefer to think that he follows in the wake
of the sun, always where it is hottest, caring little whether the
street be mean or opulent. I like to think of him as at the mercy
of a cold snap that ruins him, while it makes the fortune of his
fellow merchant, the hot-potato man. (What a beautiful poem
Tennyson would have made of that ... the golden wheel turning,
and raising high, now the ice-cream, then the hot potato ... and
always above a noble voice bidding them hope and pray.) Of
course, there are no hot-potato men now. I wonder what happened
to them. Indeed, that is what oppresses the curious when he
considers the wanderers: what becomes of them when they are
no longer strong enough to ply their strange trades and to range
the world? Are our workhouses full of crossing-sweepers who
sweep no more? Perhaps it is not so tragic, after all, to have been
a crossing-sweeper and to end in the workhouse; I cannot imagine
a crossing-sweeper murmuring with Mr Kipling: ‘Me that ’ave
been what I’ve been!’ for he has never been more than what
Mr Tim Healy would call a movable fixture. He has just sat
and touched his cap, and been tipped, and has occasionally swept.
But he must have meditated. No man can sit for ten hours a
day in the same place without meditating; I say this without
authority, for I have known only one crossing-sweeper who
meditated to any effect; he was a pronounced optimist, and
believed that the world was getting better and better, this because,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
for forty years, he had been observing the quality of people’s
boots. As he put it, when he started in life some of them wore
no boots; later on, they began to wear other people’s cast-off
boots; now they were getting on to buy their own boots, and
what with that, and what with the skirts getting shorter and
shorter, and the stocking getting thinner and thinner, by gum,
he was blowed if he knew what was going to happen next.</p>

<p>No, crossing-sweepers are not wanderers. They are limpets.
I should not have thought of them if they were not street folk,
for it is a distinguishing trait of the wanderer that he is a street
creature, something that appears from the stones in the early
morning, and at night into the stones seems to vanish. The
London wanderer may have a home, but only in the sense of the
London sparrow. Can you imagine the flower-girl’s home?
If the flower-girl were indeed the sort of flower-girl of whom you
see half a hundred portraits every year in the Royal Academy,
a sort of pure and peach-blossom girl, she would have a home
like Mélisande, very, very small and dainty (you know, the
Charbonnel and Walker-Marcus Stone style), with chairs covered
in flowered chintzes, and a white cat. At night she would lie in
her little white bed, over the head of which would hang a text
about the lilies of the field; her fair hair would ripple over the
pillow; her rosy lips would open in a sweet smile as she dreamed
of the dear little faded flowers which she had stood for the night
in her tooth-glass. (Tooth-glass! Nasty realist touch; I shall
never do this sort of thing properly.) Ah, if it were only like that!
If she were not a big, fine woman of about forty, tied up in three
thick shawls, which imperfectly conceal her tidal bodice; if only
she did not so much love a quartern of gin. It would be much
more romantic, but I should regret her if she were to turn into a
picture post card, for she is such a jolly good, saucy sort, as a rule,
and I like her thick hand terminated by five sausages, one of
these sausages strangulated by a wedding ring, the thickness
of which places one beyond all cynicism as to the permanence
of the tie. You see her in many places, by the fountain at Piccadilly
Circus, until all the nobs have bought a bunch of violets for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
somebody, now that they have given up the habit of buying a
flower for themselves; then you see her near restaurant entrances,
cleverly shaming men into buying flowers for women who are
already wearing some, and who do not know what to do with the
offering because it is invariably very wet; later on, outside theatres
near the queues; she is all enterprise, and during the war I even
saw her trying to sell to an unpromising margarine queue.</p>

FLOWER-GIRL<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>She grows old at her trade; it is a healthy one, and she has
no home. Some of her fellows are stranger and still more definably
homeless. Thus the muffin-man, killed, perhaps, by the war.
It is a long time since I heard his bell, and was thereby assured
that Sunday was getting on nicely, and would be over by-and-by.
There is the travelling accountant, a real wanderer, that one,
who, every day and night, goes from little shop to little factory,
continually confronted with new names, new deals, and, perhaps,
new and complicated methods of dishonesty. There are the
queerest and most incomprehensible of all, the guides. I do not
know what turns a man into a guide, but if you stand awhile near
Charing Cross, and make a noise like a Jugo-Slav, it is likely that
a seedily, respectably dressed man, with a badly rolled umbrella,
will offer to show you the town. Once it is clear that he does not
want to exchange pocket-books with you to show his confidence,
he may lead you to Henry V.’s chapel, to Westminster Abbey,
to Carlyle’s house, and so on, reciting as he goes, something like
this: ‘The painted ’all was originally planned by King John the
same who signed that Magna Charta in the year 1215 but the
plans being lost in the Wash the project did not come to take
form before the year 1533 when King Henry VIII. after his
marriage with Anne Boleyn laid the foundations on the plans of
Sir ’Erbert ’Opkins who was also the architect of the golden
tower of Muswell ’Ill where Nell Gwynn ...’ and so on. That
man is a gramophone; I once let him show me Saragossa, but he
shall never show me anything more. For one thing, I believe he
is respectable at heart, and there is no profit in his company. The
only good guide is the amateur guide. I met one in Brussels
once, a cab-driver, who stopped before the café where I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
having a drink; he so many times cried out to me, ‘Hi, Englishman!
you’re a sportsman, come along!’ that I fell a prey to his
flattery. (Who told him that every Englishman wants to be
thought a sportsman?) He knew his Brussels pretty well, but I
will not tell you the rest of the story, for he also knew his
Englishman pretty well.</p>

<p>There are many more of these strange people. A strange one
was a woman who offered to give me a thousand guesses at her
profession; I declined the proposal and found out that she was
a pearl-threader. Few of us know that the silken thread, on which
collars of pearls are strung, wears out, and that, from time to
time, pearls have to be re-strung. All women do not care to
send their pearls to the jeweller, for the art of Tecla is profound.
Nor do they care to re-thread them themselves, for the holes are
so small that the work is infinitely wearisome. So my pearl-threader,
who looked like the most respectable type of retired
maid, spent her life in Mayfair and Belgravia, where she sat
re-threading pearls while the owner read a novel. The pearl-threader
smiled as she told this: ‘One of them,’ she said, ‘read
a newspaper upside down all the time while I was doing her pearls.
And there is another, so unsuspicious; she turns her back on
me and smokes a cigarette, and stares into the looking-glass,
dreamy-like.’</p>

<p>But that is a high walk of wanderer. There are others more
tragic. There used to be a terrible creature, the runner, who
followed four-wheelers laden with luggage, and arrived at the end
of his long run too blown to be red in the face, but lead white,
his right hand gripped to his heart, his left hand spasmodically
touching the greasy brim of his cap. I have seen no greater
agony than the hungry desire in those filmy eyes, half-obscured
by the wet, dust-laden eyelids. I used to stop the runners when
I could; often they persisted, their open mouth close to the
wheel; they could not see me wave them away, or they could not
hear me call out, as if all the energy of their poor senses had
passed into those eternally running legs. One of them seized
my trunk as we arrived, before I could ransom myself, hating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
my opulence, full of shame. It is fifteen years ago, but I remember
him, a big body, but little flesh; I remember his eyes like glass,
and the awful stagger of him as he bent under the weight of the
trunk, as he tottered, and as I leaped to seize it when it fell. Then
the door opened, and the hotel waiter came out with the air of
black hostility which the house dog has for the street dog. The
runner looked at us without anger, without misery, though he
understood very well that the job was not for him; he was like
a Greek peasant patiently encountering fate. But, as he turned
away, clasping my shilling in his hand, and I saw the foot in the
broken boot fumble for the step, a wave of self-hatred rose in me.
I told myself: ‘You have crucified him.’</p>

<p>They are not so tragic, all of them, unaccountable people,
or even people who have adopted trades one thinks queer because
one would not have adopted them oneself. Some are merely
disgusting, such as the bus-conductor. I have met a civil bus-conductor;
I have even met an optimistic one, but nowadays,
especially, he stands exposed by comparison with the girl-conductor.
Oh, it is natural enough that the girl should have been
friendly, civil, clean, obliging, for to her the job was new, varied,
faintly exciting, probably better paid than her previous work. But
still, she made the man terrible. He seems to be nearly always
a rather grimy, ill-shaven, misanthropic man; something of the
watch-dog and of the bureaucrat has crept into his constitution;
he cannot gently ask for fares; the demand must come with a
snap and a snarl, pitched on a high note that shall reach the
recesses of the omnibus and of the traveller’s consciousness.
When he yelps: ‘Fares!’ I feel for my ticket as if I were guilty;
when he looks at me, his little, hard eye suggests that I am bilking
the company, and then I hate him so that, if I can, I do bilk the
company, and get off four hundred yards to the good, bursting
with an unexpelled shout of ‘Yah!’ I hate him above all because,
so often, he companions my journey with a snarly chorus, addressed
sometimes to the wretched nearest occupant. One hears him run
on: ‘Some people can’t learn where buses stop; seem to think
it’s the Lord Mayor’s coach; pulling the string themselves, too;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
might as well be no conductor.’ Or it is something like this:
‘Chucking their half-crowns about; taking about four hours
finding ’em, too; come into the bus and expect to get change
as if it was a blooming bank; gave her twenty-four ha’pennies
though, that’ll learn her.’ Or, during a shower: ‘Plenty
room on top. Drop o’ rain won’t ’urt yer. When it’s fine they
all want to get on top.’ And so on, a regular orgy of grace and
charm. Growl, grouse, snap, snarl, grumble, yap, and long,
dirty moustaches, filthy hands, and if it is not a grudging black
hand to help a white sleeve on to the bus, it is a hand that has to
restrain itself not to shove the white shoulder off. All that because
the poor brute is not happy. I know I ought to be sympathetic,
for it must be dreadful to travel all day from Camden Town to
Brixton and back, to sell so small a variety of goods, never to feel
steady ground under your feet when you look for change, to
answer the same idiotic question seventy times a day, to tread on
feet, to have your feet trodden on. The bus-conductor is a nasty
man because he is an unhappy man, because he has no prospect
in life, save that of growing older and, for all I know, retiring
without a pension. Those monotonous occupations, such as the
hellish one of lift-man, ought not to be human occupations, and
they will not be such some day. Meanwhile, they rack by
boredom people to whom has not been given the free expanse
of the pedlar. What a brute Charon must have become by
now!</p>

<p>Those people who range freely street and field are indeed
of another kind; there is in them less civilisation and more civility.
They are detached from their fellows; they lead lives of their own
within the beating life of the world. Many of the newspaper-sellers
are pleasant, ironic people, with a capacity for estimating
character, with a quick interest in the news they retail. Citizens
of the world, they are often so stimulated by their news that, as
you buy, they must tell you the contents of the stop-press. It is
a hard trade. Before the war they used to pay ninepence for
twenty-seven halfpenny papers: fourpence-halfpenny profit for
selling twenty-seven papers! Still, there is a nomadic satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
in their movable beat. They are not locked up. They are in the
midst of life, other people’s life, but yet life.</p>

<p>To quite another class belong the beggars, not the pseudo-beggars
who profess to sell laces or matches, or the blind, for
these are inanimate beggars and nobody knows what goes on
behind their faces, but the adventurous beggars, the old woman
who follows you, shrilly asking for the price of a cup of tea, or the
well-known teacher of French, who stops you in the street and
asks you what chance he has of a professorship at King’s College.
Those adventurers are amusing because they are coloured,
because, if you stop, they will tell you where they come from, the
number and names of their children, the diseases from which
they suffer, and, indeed, recite you the shameless novel of their lives.</p>

<p>Of the same kind, but more offensive, is the fern-seller who
is nearly always (or was before the war) a particularly burly brute,
carrying a couple of potted ferns under each arm. He haunts
the quieter streets of the West End, and when a woman alone
meets him late at night, she will do well to make for the nearest
policeman, the proper method being to ask the fern-seller to
carry the ferns home for her: a policeman will doubtless be
encountered on the way. I remember a fern-seller, who accosted
me once in Portman Square. It was about six o’clock in the
evening; I told the man that I wanted no ferns; he followed
me, rumbling abuse which I could hardly hear. As it happened,
I was looking for lodgings, and stopped at a likely house in
Portman Street. As I had been walking rather fast, I thought
that I had got rid of him, but, seeing I was going into a house,
he ran up behind me, and once more began his pressure. While
I was ordering him off the door opened, and a fat little landlord,
with a grubby little white beard and choleric little blue eyes in a
puffy little pink face, stood staring in the doorway. ‘If you don’t
go,’ I said to the man, ‘I’ll give you in charge.’ But the man
went on whining and growling and, being very young, I was
filled with awful confusion at this brawl on the step. This was
increased by the nasty little landlord, who said: ‘What do you
want?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
‘I want to see some rooms,’ I replied, and to the fern-seller:
‘Did you hear what I said?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve got no rooms,’ snapped the landlord, ‘get out of it,
both of you.’</p>

<p>‘What the devil do you mean by both of you?’ I said to the
landlord, being thoroughly enraged. Then I became paralysed
at having to quarrel on two different subjects simultaneously.</p>

<p>‘Mean by it!’ shouted the little landlord. ‘What do <em>you</em>
mean by creating a disturbance on my doorstep? Let rooms to
the likes of you! You’re drunk!’</p>

<p>At that moment the fern-seller was breathing on me, and I
saw that the landlord’s words were well-founded, though ill-directed.
Before I could think of a reply, the little landlord
slammed his door so as to make the whole of Portman Street
shake. And I remained alone with the fern-seller, who still
painstakingly and threateningly attempted to make me buy
ferns. He was the sort of man who speaks from under his under
lip. I was so ashamed that I did not say one word, but ran. Oh!
how good and free Oxford Street felt.</p>

<p>I have not been much annoyed or interested by the more
desperate wanderers one comes across. Only once did anything
perilous come my way, and that I will call ‘The Row in Homer
Row.’ It was many years ago. I had, one evening, made an
acquaintanceship with the light fallibility that will, I hope,
always characterise youth. It did not at once have results; some
other business intervened, but I remember quite well that I
returned at nine o’clock to a little block of flats, that were not
exactly flats, but superior model dwellings. I remember the
hard, stone stairs and the iron banisters, you will soon see why.
As I left, later in the evening, I shut the door of the flat behind
me, and stood for a second in the entire blackness of the landing.
Then I felt a foot against my left ankle, and a hand grip my left
arm. It was the darkness saved me, for it is not easy accurately
to seize an arm in the dark, and the notorious ‘pull-over’ is not
suited for cellar blackness. I remember that I did not think,
that I did not have time to be afraid. I remember only the vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
unchaining of a self-protective instinct, that swung my right
hand across to the left. I swear I did not will it. And I still
have unforgettably in my knuckles the sensation of crash and
give, in my ears the curious, fat sound, something like ‘kroch,’
that was made by some teeth giving way under the blow. And
then there was an immensely long pause, during which I had
time to think; it may have lasted a tenth of a second. There
was a dull, muffled sound, that of a head striking the iron banisters.
That is all, except that I remember the clatter of my feet on the
stone stairs.</p>

<p>But to the man who wanders in London streets at night, and
I am one of these, stranger things happen. One of those cases
was ‘The Poisoned Girl of Grosvenor Square.’ It was about
twelve o’clock at night. As I turned out of Brook Street into the
Square, I saw on my right two people by the railings of an area.
One was a woman dressed in black, kneeling down and holding
on to the railings by one hand. The other was a man, who stood
a few yards off, with statue-like immobility. I remember thinking:
‘This is awkward. He has been knocking her about, and I
suppose I shall have to say something, and if he attacks me in
front no doubt she’ll attack me from behind.’ But still, there was
nothing to do but to say something. So I went up to them, and
suddenly realised that the two people had nothing to do with
each other. She was kneeling in that frozen attitude, and he was
looking on. The girl was young, very white, with masses of
fair hair. She was neatly dressed in black, and looked like a
parlourmaid. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed hardly to
breathe. Two or three times I asked her what was the matter,
but she did not reply. Then only did I look at the man, who
was evidently of another class. A rather large, square man, the
sort of man whom you know to be bald, though he has his hat
on, with a moustache that was too thick, and cheeks that were
too healthy, a phlegmatic, staring man.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter with her?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said the man.</p>

<p>As it was clear that he was the sort of man who wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
know, I turned to the girl and, taking her by the shoulder, tried
to make her stand up. I was surprised to find her limp instead of
stiff, and she fell back against my shoulder with a little groan.</p>

<p>‘Let me alone,’ she murmured.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter?’ I asked again. ‘Are you in any
trouble?’</p>

<p>‘Let me alone,’ she said again.</p>

<p>I felt irritated because she did not realise that I couldn’t let
her alone, that man’s code compelled me to torture her, and that
nothing in the world could allow me to let her alone.</p>

<p>‘Let me help you,’ I said, feeling that I behaved like a
considerable idiot. ‘What is it?’</p>

<p>She opened her eyes a little, and murmured: ‘I’ve taken
something.’</p>

<p>‘Taken something?’ I repeated, vaguely thinking of theft.
‘What do you mean? Taken something.’</p>

<p>‘Poison,’ she said. Then again: ‘Let me alone.’</p>

<p>I hear the shrillness of my voice as I cried out: ‘Poison!’;
then I found myself hurrying her along the pavement; ‘What is
it?’ I said to her, as we went. ‘Is it laudanum? You’ve got to
walk, you know,’ and to the man: ‘Hurry up. Get a cab.’ There
was no cab to be seen. ‘Come along!’ I shouted. ‘Run ahead
and get a cab.’ After a moment’s hesitation he waddled away,
not much faster than we. And now the girl was almost weeping,
while I tortured her with questions, tried to make her run, this
one idea of laudanum in my mind. At last she answered: ‘Spirits
of salt.’</p>

<p>It took us very long, I think, to get up North Audley Street,
and I felt rent by her youth and her prettiness, for the fair hair
was coming unbound on my shoulder. There was a tenderness
in me as I lifted her at last into the cab. I remember saying to
the man, ‘You’ve been pretty slow about it. I hope you haven’t
killed her. What were you doing staring at her instead of doing
something?’</p>

<p>Then he said: ‘Oh, well, one doesn’t want to be mixed up.’</p>

THE HEART OF THE CITY<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>There is no end to this story. I took her to the Middlesex,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and they saved her by means of the stomach pump: to this day
I cannot help wishing that her salvation might have had a more
romantic name. But much more impressive is the man’s remark.
I should not wonder if most people go through life with a single
end in view: not to be mixed up. And one might as well be
dead as not be mixed up. I have been much more mixed up than
I dare tell in this respectable volume. I stole a baby once.</p>

<p>That is the story of ‘The Stolen Baby of Pimlico.’ I was
waiting for an omnibus one night at the Chippenham. A young,
dark girl was also waiting for the omnibus, but as she was showing
more signs of impatience than are usual, namely, stamping, I
could not help being interested. At last, as she passed me and
flung me a look of intense malevolence, which I felt was rather
unfair, I could not help smiling and saying: ‘I wonder whether
there are any more buses.’ (Now I come to think of it, I might
have said something more soothing.) This had the unexpected
result of arousing confidence. ‘There’s got to be another bus,’
she said. ‘I’ve got to fetch my sister’s baby.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ I remarked.</p>

<p>We said no more for some time, and still no omnibus came.
Then a taxi crawled up to us, and I said: ‘Well, if there are no
more buses we had better take this taxi.’ The dark girl, who was
young and very pretty, put on an expression of increased
malevolence, but as I stopped the taxi, she said: ‘Oh, all right then, but
I give the cabman the address, and not you.’ As we sat down,
I gathered from this that my wanderer was no fledgling. But,
after a few minutes, as she discovered that I made no attempt to
kiss her, she became confidential. She had run away from an
evil stepmother. She had £2 10s. She had just taken a furnished
flat at £3 10s. a week. She was nineteen. She was going on the
stage. Also, she wouldn’t have gone away if it hadn’t been for
her father. (Rather mixed, this.) As we drew nearer to Pimlico
I became more and more confused, for the baby was turning
into her sister-in-law’s baby, and I swear that he became a she.
We stopped in a little black street in Pimlico, in front of an
enormous Victorian house which was still blacker than the street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
‘I must ring,’ said the girl, and promptly took from her little bag
a key. Therefore she did not ring, but disappeared into the
house, the inside of which was blacker than the outside, leaving
the door wide open. After I had waited for a moment she came
out again: ‘I say,’ she said, ‘I can’t carry him down; he’s too
heavy.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ I thought, ‘now I’m in for it. But they can’t have
laid much of a trap for a young man picked up outside the
Chippenham.’ So, true to my principles, I went in. The house
stank of solitude. It was the sort of house that does not even
creak. I felt my way up to the first floor, and in a back room
where there was very little besides a bed and a couple of chairs,
I found asleep a pretty boy aged about five. ‘Pick him up,’
murmured the girl, ‘and don’t make a noise, I don’t want to
wake the woman so late.’ Obediently I picked him up, and
carried him down into the taxi. Just as the girl was about to
follow me in, she said: ‘Now I’d better pay the woman. Lend
me two shillings.’ In a few moments she came back, and some
time later made me pull up the taxi at the corner of a side street,
off Elgin Avenue.</p>

<p>Only later did all these confusions, this mixture of sexes and
relationships, the silence in the silent house, lead me to theories.
Little by little they crystallised into this: I seem to have stolen a
baby I don’t know, belonging to somebody I don’t know, and
taken it I don’t know where, in the charge of I don’t know whom.
It preyed on me rather. I even worked up an alibi. Now I
suppose it does not matter, as the child may be a householder.</p>

<p>There are many other stories I should like to tell, that of
‘The Watchmaker and the Four Pounds of Black-Lead,’ though,
really, the adventure of ‘The Two Girls from County Cork and
the Lost Camisole,’ is much more remarkable, but these and
others must appear in another volume. There are many of these
people, and one never discovers them before ten o’clock or so.
They live in the streets, where they have their loves and their
tragedies, and mainly in those places where there is not too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
light. They like the darkness because the light of human understanding
is not good for their peculiar affairs. We do not think
enough of the influence of light. When we stand on Primrose
Hill and, as Karl Baedeker would put it, behold before us the
rich expanse of a great and sleeping city, we do not individualise
the lights enough. When we look down upon Piccadilly
Circus flaring from every veranda, and, like the laburnum,
dropping wells of fire, when in these days we stand at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road and watch the electric signs:
‘Player’s Navy Mixture,’ ‘Meux’s London Original Stout,’
‘Y.M.C.A.,’ and ‘Tube,’ when we walk in all that brightness,
we do not realise that this is the spirit of our city, the rather
crude, commercial, and friendly spirit of London. Nor, in other
cities at night, say in Birmingham, where through the dirty glass
falls dirty yellow light, do we perceive in man unambitiousness.
For mankind must have light. Light alone opens the windows
on life, and makes night Arabian.</p>

<p>Only one creature likes the dark, and that is a wanderer, the
cat. Have you watched cats at night? If you try in the street
to stroke cats when the mood of night is on them, when they
crouch under a bush, rolled up into tight balls, their sharp heads
sunk into the woolly folds of their shoulders, when some are
shadows in the shadow, spotted with two points of fire, they
will not shrink from you, nor approach you, but so remain in
static life. Or they will swiftly pass you, at that queer, soft trot,
making towards a secret direction with entire intentness. Or,
one upon the steps of a house, the other on a balustrade, they
will face each other with swishing tails, and so remain in immense
motion within the same spot, an infinity of provocation in every
shiver of their sleek flanks; you, human, shall not know whether
they are minded to love or war. If you interfere, you break the
spell of their communication, but there is no room for you in
their compact. You are the spectre of the commander, and they
flee. But you shall feel the hostility they have left behind them;
it flows from the immense cruelty of their cold eyes, that are lovely
as emerald and topaz, that can harbour no love, but only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
voluptuousness, calm, deep eyes that calculate and fix only upon that
which can serve them, eyes that glimpse only things they fear
and things they desire, not things for which they may suffer. You
shall stay awhile in that hostile ambiance, while they have fled
into the night, to adventures more secret and profound than any
that may be yours, even though you, too, be one of Diana’s foresters,
a gentleman of the shade, a minion of the moon.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOUPS AND STEWS</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> another chapter of this book the change that has come over
London feeding has already been indicated. The times when
respectability edicted that one should eat only within the family
circle, when all that could be obtained abroad was a stodgy meal
of bread and cheese at a coffee-house, or the lightest refreshment
at Vauxhall or Cremorne, are long gone by; to-day, almost as
many meals are consumed at restaurants as under homely roofs.
It was a long battle the restaurants waged under the early banners
of Hatchett’s or the Café Royal and, strange to say, the Grand
Hotel. Yes, once upon a time the Grand Hotel, that ancestor,
was the latest thing; in the eighties it was ‘the thing’ to lunch
or stay at the Grand Hotel. But, in those days, ‘the thing’ was
rather a scandalous thing, and if one lunched or dined away from
home one felt dissipated; one had to choose one’s company when
taking a meal thus, for the worst was easily thought of one in 1880,
while to-day, the best is hoped for. (There is, perhaps, no great
difference between the two attitudes.)</p>

<p>In those days the home was a British institution; it figured
in the solemn list which numbered suet pudding, the royal family,
bustles, Tennyson, the evangelical attitude, and chenille decoration
of mantelpieces. The home had its rights; indeed, it had all
rights; it was the place where you ought to want to be, and far
from which you would naturally feel remorse; it was the thing
you had to ‘keep together,’ the thing you had to ‘make,’ to
‘save’; your self-abnegation should have told you that you had
no rights except to add the pillar of your person to those of the
porch. It has gone, this Victorian rectitude; it has gone the way
of Dundreary whiskers and of weepers round the hat; I suspect
that the restaurant habit, as it is called, has turned some of the
sods for its grave. There is something relaxing in a restaurant,
at least to a people such as ours, afflicted with a considerable
sense of private licence and of public dignity. Restaurant dining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
outrages in us a sort of modesty, and, like most Puritans, we
rather enjoy having our modesty outraged; it is the revenge of
the flesh, and it pleases us godly men to discover in ourselves a
streak of the devil. We feel this rather more in the foreign
restaurants than in the British; in the British eating-houses,
where there is no menu, but only a bill of fare, where understandable
things, such as mock-turtle soup, boiled mutton with caper
sauce, and roly-poly are offered us, we know too well where we
are; we eat, instead of giving way to greediness; by avoiding
that temptation we avoid one of the cardinal sins, and more’s the
pity. In foreign restaurants, however, where neither the name
of the dish nor the form it assumes is understandable, we can
develop a sense of sin; we can do this because our feet are set on
foreign ways, all of which lead to Babylon. Foreign waiters
address us, and there is no virtue in their eyes; they look like
assassins, and it is thrilling to think that they may be assassins,
or nihilists, or grand-dukes. Foreigners dine at the tables; their
women are too smart to be good; the yellow-backed novels they
bring in must surely be undesirable; they are poorly clad, which
proves that they lead sinful lives; they are richly dressed, which
points to evil courses. They are foreign. Is not the Drury Lane
villain foreign?</p>

<p>
SOHO MARKET<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>From this sense of sin arose in the beginning the popularity
of the Soho restaurants. I do not know when they began to be
popular. Some, such as the Restaurant d’Italie, the Monico,
the Villa Villa, are old stagers, but when I first came to town
their customers were mostly men; if couples came they generally
included a man who did not care to take his womenkind to such
places, but did not mind taking other people’s womenkind.
(Thus it worked out just the same in the end.) The growth of
London, which compelled men to live farther and farther out,
favoured the restaurants, for distant dormitories drive men to
proximate refectories. The Soho restaurant grew in numbers,
together with the Cabins, the Lyons’s, the J.P.’s, and others, but
at the same time, because they provided pleasant fare at low prices,
they gained advertisement from the men who first frequented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
them. Thus the women heard of them, and they liked them
immensely, for the Soho restaurant provides exactly the sort of
meal that many women want: next to nothing, pleasantly served.
So, in the last dozen years, they have prospered enormously;
the early ones, such as Brice’s, Le Diner Français, Au Petit Riche,
found many rivals such as the Moulin d’Or, the Mont Blanc,
Chantecler, Maxim’s, the Rendezvous, etc. Their career has
been curiously uniform. Nearly all have been started by a chef,
a waiter who had saved up a small working capital or married
well. Being foreigners, the proprietors liked good cooking, and
in the beginning every Soho restaurant offered a good meal.
To-day there are still a few where the proprietor circulates among
the tables, asking you whether you are satisfied, and naïvely begs
congratulation, but that state of mind is rare. So long as the
customers were mainly foreign, the standard was kept up: small,
important, subtle things were done, such as steaming vegetables
instead of boiling them, such as putting in salt while the meat
cooked. But the Englishmen who came to lunch, having advertised
their wonderful find, grew very proud of it, began to bring
their friends, their sisters, and, nowadays, even their aunts. They
came in increasing numbers, and the proprietors discovered
three things: that there were in London more Londoners than
foreigners; that the Londoners were willing to pay more than
the foreigners; that they either didn’t know what they ate, or
that they didn’t care. As very few of the proprietors were in
business as artists; as, moreover, they grew discouraged when
they went round the tables and asked people whether they had
enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and were asked: ‘Were they
stuffed?’ they ceased to take pains. They found out what the
English customer wanted: paper flowers on the tables, Japanese
fans, and dishes with incomprehensible names. So, one after
the other, they began to cater for a purely English clientèle; a good
many have discovered that the English customers expect made-up
meats instead of, say, roast beef, and are willing to take those
meats on trust; so the wise proprietor, in many cases, makes up
his menu from the dishes left over from the night before at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Carlton or the Ritz. After all, he gives them what they want:
a dissipated atmosphere. Not long ago, I watched four school
mistresses in a state of considerable dissipation. They sat in the
little restaurant, laughing rather more shrilly than they would
have at Simpson’s, as if excited by the rather excessive effect of
prettiness, the mauve walls, the blue and yellow curtains, the
pretty fringed shades. Oh, how one understood Sally Bishop!
How the mellow spirit of Mr Temple Thurston brooded with
folded wings over the little place! The school mistresses listened
hungrily for French, which was being spoken by the attendants,
and they kept a wary eye upon their fellow lunchers: sober couples
drinking claret; young men and women, the latter unpowdered,
the former oppressed by sartorial self-righteousness. There
was nothing against the lunch; it was a nice, ordinary little lunch;
the sort of well-cooked little lunch that could be turned out by
the gross, out of a machine, all the year round, every little lunch
alike, for ever and ever. But my school mistresses were tasting
dissipation while avoiding vice.</p>

<p>In true cooking one does not avoid vice. One courts vice.
One says: ‘Eating is a sensuality, and we shall satisfy our senses
as much as we can. We shall sing hymns to it; people have sung
hymns to drinking, why not to eating? We are not ashamed of
“feasting” our eyes and our ears; why not our palates?’ Some
people understand this. Mr Anatole France sums it up well
when analysing a Castelnaudary <span class="locked">stew:—</span></p>

<p>‘The Castelnaudary stew contains the preserved thighs of
geese, whitened beans, bacon, and a little sausage. To be good
it must have been cooked lengthily upon a gentle fire. Clemence’s
stew has been cooking for twenty years. She puts into the stew
sometimes goose or bacon, sometimes sausage or beans, but it is
always the same stew. The foundation endures; this ancient
and precious foundation gives the stew the quality that in the
picture of old Venetian masters you find in the women’s amber
flesh.’</p>

<p>If you are a proper person you will call this disgusting; you
will feel that this is an indecent subject, and that an author who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
dares to head his chapter ‘Soups and Stews’ ought in another
world to be chained for a thousand years to the ghost of Colonel
Newnham Davis. That is a legacy of the past; not more than
twenty years ago it was indeed indecent to discuss food, and if a
vulgarian did so, the only thing the lady of the house could reply
was: ‘Oh, really!’ The war has altered that, and I am inclined
to hope that people who endlessly discussed the difference between
butter and margarine, the advantages to be found in neck of
mutton, will maintain these not ignoble preoccupations. I believe
they will, for they were moving that way; they had already left
far behind the Victorian lady with a wasp waist who ‘daintily
pecked at her dinner like a little bird.’ They may one day adopt
Brillat-Savarin’s dictum: ‘Let me cook your ministers’ dishes,
and they will give you good laws.’</p>

<p>But, leaving aside Soho, which is, after all, only the culinary
frontier, we find that the restaurant has spread over the whole of
London, carrying everywhere its gospel of satisfaction. This
gospel takes various forms, for restaurants fall into different
classes according to their locality and their prices. There are the
pompous, like the Carlton, the Savoy, the Popular Café; there
are the distinguished, such as Claridge’s, Jules’s, Dieudonné’s;
there are the fanciful, such as Pagani, Verrey’s, old Gambrinus,
Bellomo’s, Gustave, the Savoyard, the Chinese, the Japanese,
the Greek; there is the slab-of-meat class, such as Gatti’s,
Simpson’s, to say nothing of the Shepherd’s Bush Restaurant,
and the Tulse Hill Hotel; above all there is the restaurant of the
Joseph Lyons civilisation, the Strand Palace Hotel, the Regent
Palace, the Strand Corner House.</p>

<p>They all deserve their little word, and it is difficult to say of
each of them just what should be said, because they have so much
in common, yet are so far apart, like brothers and sisters. There
is a flavour of Joseph Lyons at the Savoy, while Gatti has Reggiori
for a little relative. Yet, when one comes to know them well,
they are all so different. No one, for instance, could mistake the
Carlton for the Savoy; both have a broad spaciousness born of
their size, of the comparative expensiveness of their meats;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
both are lofty and white and clean; their glass is pretty good,
and their plate so-so. But while the Carlton maintains a certain
air of having selected from among the not very select, the Savoy
shows little sign of having tried that much. To lunch at the
Savoy makes one feel not so much that one is among the rich as
among the well-to-do on short leave. The Savoy is sober; its
luxury is quieter than that of the Joseph Lyons restaurant; in a
way, with its top lights, its flowers, it recalls the Joseph Lyons
civilisation; the flowers are real, but not much more so; the
band is more discreet, but it plays the same tunes. Its population,
too, is different; at the Savoy, you do not see the young clerk,
but you do see what some of the young clerks will become if they
are lucky; many foreigners in a state of gormandise and bejewelment;
rather dowdy people, too, the well-off dowdy, whose
sideboards must be taken to pieces before they can be got into
country cottages. The business element is strong. Somehow,
one tells a business man fairly easily; he wears good clothes that
nearly fit him; his hair is well cut, his cheek is well shaved, but
a consciousness of the barber’s art hangs about his head; his
elegance is not a natural product, it is one of the goods which he
produces; he misses ‘the line’ which some sediment of aristocracy
or musical-comedy upstart achieves better than will ever the
business man’s solidities. There is too much meat upon his
cheeks; you feel that he is a little too rich, just as his eyes are a
little too bright; he is like a very new knife that has not yet learned
to cut.</p>

<p>
THE SAVOY<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>Others, too, Americans, who are happier in those big hotels
than any of the English, because hotel-life is, in many of them,
an acquired characteristic. They are interesting, those Savoy
Americans, abundant women, exquisite girls made of beautifully
tinted steel-plate, those men with the square shoulders, square
chins, square heads, cubic cheeks; you know, without being
told, that they are connected with the cinema trade, or that they
are producing a play by Mr Montague Glass or Mr Bayard Veiller,
or that they are selling many motor-cars, or something like that.
(The American who comes to Europe for the purpose of exporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
art to Pittsburg is not found at the Savoy; he goes to Chelsea
and Fitzroy Square.) And yet it is not a disagreeable place; its
breadth, the airy width of plate-glass that looks out upon the
Thames, the cheapness and the adequacy of its food, all these
are part of the new restaurant of the new civilisation, which has
replaced the little taverns in the little corners of the town. It is
no use being sentimental over the little restaurant, or, indeed,
over anything little: there are too many of us for anything little
to be much more than a survival. If restaurants did not feed us
a thousand at a time, they would never manage to feed us all.</p>

<p>One thinks of that in the small restaurants that have survived,
such as Verrey’s. To many people it seems a queer thing to
lunch at Verrey’s; it seems rather out of date, and, indeed, when
one approaches that frontage, painted a sort of faded 1850 blue
and provided with coloured glass, one has a sense of antiquity.
Inside antiquity is still more striking, for the big, square room
under the skylight manages at the same time to be drab in colour
and Moorish Gothic in architecture. It still has the many mirrors
of the ’fifties, an air of being comfortably off enough to afford to
be dowdy. Rakish and dowdy! Can anything better translate
the amusements of two generations ago? To-day, Verrey’s gives
you a fair lunch, and at its café tables, which are somehow more
substantial than the café tables of Paris, you understand what
England thought the Continent must be like in the days of the
Grand Tour.</p>

<p>There are other places, fanciful as Verrey’s. There is Bellomo’s,
in Jermyn Street, a modest, pleasant little place, a long, narrow
back room filled with agreeable young couples. Bellomo’s is
rather like a young-old man, with its panelled wainscoting, its
wallpaper of faded gold, and its moulded, early Victorian frieze.
There is something solid about its dumb waiters; Bellomo’s is
somehow benevolent.</p>

<p>But then Verrey’s and Bellomo’s are within limited flights of
fancy. The curious gastronome will, in London, easily find queerer
places and foods. At Pagani’s he can come to understand that
risotto may well be eaten in Valhalla; at Gambrinus’s, the Regent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Street one, of course, he could, before the war, when it was German,
find unexpected delight in liver-sausage sandwiches, with perfectly
sour gherkins, and, heaven of heavens, really cold beer. In those
days it was decorated with antlers, enormous fanciful jugs, out
of which you enormously drank the frozen gold of that beer.
I think it has become Belgian since the war; I am not quite sure,
for I went there only once after the transfer.</p>

<p>But the truly curious go not to foreigners like Pagani or
Gambrinus, or even to Gustave, where the foods are truly French,
or to the Savoyard, where they are French and eatable under the
eye of strange pictures; the truly curious go not to the foreigner,
but to the professional foreigner, to restaurants such as the Greek,
the Chinese, or the Japanese. Of these the Chinese is the most
attractive. I mean the Cathay, next door to the Monico, not the
Chinese restaurants in Limehouse, where nothing is eatable, and
nothing is tragic, and nothing is coloured, let Mr Thomas Burke
say what he likes. A lunch at the Chinese restaurant is really an
adventure, for nearly all the dishes are made of the same things,
and yet they all taste different. There is an admirable dish,
hang-yang-kai-ting, made of fried chicken with almonds and
bamboo shoots. That is a simple one, and the curious will find
more profit in a dish the name of which I have forgotten, which
contains fried sliced pork, celery, beans, sprouts, mushrooms,
bamboo shoots, and green chutney. Eat that, and it is a very
large, overflowing, savoury portion; flavour it well with chop-suey
(which you can call liquid salt if you are a foreign devil).
Eat it immediately after chicken liver soup, and if you do not
forget before swallowing the bamboo shoots to chew, and chew,
and chew, then a true mellowness will be known to you. Also,
do not forget the great bowl of boiled rice, pure, white rice,
perfectly dried, not sticky rice <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la A.B.C.</i>, but rice where every
grain remembers that it has a personality. Don’t ask for chopsticks:
the best people in China do not use chopsticks; they use
forks. (There used to be a Chinese restaurant where they provided
chopsticks for the English; it was great fun watching them pour
their food down their sleeves with that conscious air of duty that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
seems to overwhelm the Englishman experiencing pleasure.) And
don’t forget dessert, ginger in syrup, fire in the midst of sweetness,
like a red-haired girl; and ly-chee, large, sweet, white nuts
in an opalescent syrup, extraordinarily good.</p>

<p>But, in a way, all those places, the very rich and the very odd,
are running on their own ticket, and do not express the times in
which we live. Our modern times are the Strand Corner House.
I should not wonder if many of my readers had never been into
the Strand Corner House; that is, if they are incurious of life.
If they repent their acceptance of things as they are, they will find
an unexpectedly large building decorated with heavily flowered
stucco mouldings, with plate-glass, with stained glass, with panels
of crimson satin. They will find light, co-operative luxury;
superposed tiers, bearing crowds of people lunching on the top
of one another’s heads, and at the bottom of a deep well, a band
that can be heard above the clatter of twelve hundred pairs of
jaws. A thousand people at a time really eat all together
at the Strand Corner House, and, in a way, no wonder.
The place is quite clean, not offensive in its appurtenances, and
can supply three courses for less than two shillings; the music
is the ordinary dance or sentimental music, the sort that makes
you feel friendly or affectionate as required. The public of the
Strand Corner House is, therefore, the world. Its variety is
much greater than that of any other place. One might think that
this public would consist exclusively of flappers and their escorts,
and, indeed, the flapper is prevalent, though she comes in threes
and fours quite as much as more ostentatiously with a ‘boy.’
Also the suburbs, middle-aged couples, when the wife has been
shopping in St Paul’s Churchyard and has strayed down the
Strand; unexpectedly you see people with an air of modish vanity,
dashing people who smoke cigarettes and drink claret, damning
both the expense and the consequences. Though very few of
the frequenters could be mistaken for members of the classes,
none are members of the masses; they seem to be in a state of
social suspension; they are, especially the girls, of a rather crystalline
type. I mean that you realise their good looks at once instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
of by degrees. If you look about you, you will not fail to find
half a dozen faces that can give you the knock ... only, if you
look round the other way, you will probably see another half a
dozen faces that can give you exactly the same knock, and when
one is an old Londoner and has been getting the knock all one’s
life, well, one unfortunately comes to stand it rather well.</p>

<p>These great crowds of young people with a little money in
their pocket and much zest in their hearts tend to fall into uniform
types. The men nearly all buy their collars at the Regent Street
branches of city hosiers; the girls seem to skim the lighter froth
of the big West End stores, except that Marshall’s knows them
not. This produces a uniform quality: they have to overtake
the fashions, and so become a little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">outrées</i>.</p>

<p>Women, more readily than men, respond to the stratifications
of restaurants, because they are more adaptable. Their very
clothes show it; women are like cats, they have no bones, and
easily suit themselves to bell-mouthed skirt or hobble. The
female form is infinitely squashable and extensible; any fashion
can transform it, and if a woman has the wit to shun the becoming,
she can always be in the fashion if she dares. If she fails, it is
because she does not dare to underline her deficiency. If I were
a woman and extraordinarily tall, I should dress myself in vertical
stripes; if I were very short and very stout, I should insert the
hoops of barrels under my skirt; I should be hideous, but I should
be It, for the essence of true fashion is extremism. I said fashion,
not elegance; that is quite another story, but then, to be elegant
you must be born as the greyhound, and if you strive to elegance
you are more likely to resemble the mouse. Fashion is much
easier.</p>

SHOPPING<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>Not only in her clothes, but in herself, does the metropolitan
girl define her city. She is always the creature of the day, who
heavily overlays the creature of all time. In soups and stews she
has little part, for a woman is a poor partner at the table. She
eats and drinks, as a rule, without much science or much intentness;
she eats too little, she bolts; she does not realise that she is
doing something important and artistic. Oh, it is not that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
is lifted high above material desires, for, indeed, certain articles
of food, such as chocolates, certain drinks, such as liqueurs, make
her accept the society of the dullest and the most dreary, but
such trifles are merely the preludes and the coronals of the true
soup and the true stew. Still, she is the decoration and the charm
of the table; when Mr Lauzerte said that where there are no
women there is no true elegance, he was speaking the truth. In
matters of food they care very little what it is and very much what
it looks. Also, because few of them neglect an advantage and
prove the old adage that what woman most desires is mastery
over man, they never ignore what they look upon as a gross means
of seduction. It was a woman, I think, who told another to ‘feed
the brute.’ What an illusion! If you have to deal with a brute,
indeed, you can keep him quiet by feeding him, just as you mollify
Cerberus with a sop, but to keep a man quiet ... how unnecessary
in the early days of marriage! and how disastrous after!
It is unconsciously, I think, that women strive to please the palate
of men, that is they are unconscious of the effects of such a course.
Unless they are very unhappy they do not want to soothe the
sullen creature; they wish to produce in him a light and airy
grace, a not very promising ambition. For some men, who are
in possession of all their senses, will feel true gratitude, which
is akin to love, to the one who knows how so to flatter them. One
of them said to me not long ago: ‘It makes the day easier to feel
that I shall go back to-night to a perfectly cooked meal, and a
perfectly dressed wife.’ I am not quite sure whether he said that,
or whether it was ‘a perfectly dressed wife, and a perfectly cooked
meal,’ but anyhow, it does not matter, for in that man’s mind the
two delights had grown mixed. That is what every woman knows,
and perhaps she is wise as well as humble in hoping to mingle
with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">potage velouté</i> some of the old philtres of love.</p>

<h2 class="chapheadleft">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">IN SEARCH OF VICE</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">When</span> I first came to London I was twenty years old; I came
from Paris, and, being twenty, felt sure that there remained no
sensations for me to experience, no realms of passion to explore.
I felt that I had lived—well, lived; that I came from Babylon
city, and was now entering a Puritanic world, a place of dignities
and parliaments, of clergymen with white bibs, of ladies with
prominent teeth and elastic-sided boots who said ‘shocking’;
I also felt that I was entering the country of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le sport, le flirt</i>; I
had also been told that the English were a strange people, adepts
in every depravity, of which the secret drinking of methylated
spirits was a minor example. I admired them thoroughly, as I
admired Westminster Abbey. Briefly, a land of virtue. This
state of mind was fairly well kept up for the first year, because it
rained nearly all the time, and there is nothing like a rainy summer
to raise the moral tone of the streets. I was interested by the
life I saw round me, bored by the life I led on thirty-eight shillings
a week; I could afford little in the way of theatres; whisky made
me sick; so did Irish stew and suet pudding; I did not see as
much of my fellows as I wanted, because, in those days, I often had
to choose between a clean shirt in the evening, and a cut from
the joint at lunch. Also, my landlady washed the collie in the
bath, which annoyed me.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that I did not at once enter London’s
‘gilded haunts of vice.’ It took me a little time to discover them,
and, to be truthful, I am still looking for them. Indeed, I can
say that I have employed a considerable portion of the last eighteen
years in search of vice, and it may be that I must blame a Parisian
education for my disappointment. I thought I had found vice
the first time I saw a couple publicly embrace, opposite Marble
Arch, never having seen anything so indecent in a Continental
city; but this was an illusion, just like another illusion when, for
the first time, I heard a speaker in the Park state his true opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of the Royal Family: I thought this was the beginning of the
revolution, and could not understand why the police looked so
bored. I do now, for I suppose that meetings have been going
on for several generations. But when it came to vice, when I
explained to my new and fast English friends that I was looking
for vice, when they took me to the old Empire Promenade, when
they bade me be shocked at the condition of Regent Street, between
Vigo Street and Piccadilly Circus, when they took me to Earl’s
Court to ogle and to drink milk-coffee, when they drew my
attention to the chorus girls performing what they called orgies
in the punts near Maidenhead, a certain melancholy crept over
me. English vice was overrated. Indeed, to this day, I am sure
that there is very little vice in England, that the Londoner, particularly,
is a flighty creature, who kills virtue with his mouth, who tells
unpleasant stories about the deeds of other people, and paints the
town red with the assistance of his fancy socks. They are cowards,
really, and most of them, when they slip at all, seem to slip ignobly
into the rare satisfaction of a purely animal instinct; also, to do this,
they need drink. Nero would not have understood them at all.</p>

<p>Since those days much time has passed, and now and then,
here and there, I have come a little closer to those strange and
secret depravities of which, according to the Continent, London
holds the monopoly. The newspapers are helpful; for they
have occasional fits of virtue and begin to expose something,
thus, at last, giving it an advertisement; or the police intervene
and shut up a restaurant, thus focusing all eyes upon its proprietor
and making him so famous that when he opens another
restaurant next door he is assured of custom. And so I have
known dreadful places, manicure shops where hands were held
longer than filing demands, tea shops where the depraved waitresses
call you ‘old dear,’ and demonstrate that in a chair when there is
room for one there is room for two. It is perfectly appalling.
I have been to the old Continental and to the old Globe Restaurant
to spend considerable sums on not very satisfactory meals, to see
a number of ladies manifest a little more clearly than is the custom
the liberalism of their mind. I don’t know why it strikes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Puritan faction as so terrible that the women whom they call lost
should congregate in a particular place; it cannot be because
thus they can be found, for the Puritans must know that there is
no street in central London, no tube, no omnibus, which does
not hold as much temptation and as much opportunity as a small
room in a quiet restaurant. I suppose it is the openness of the
thing shocks them, the fact that they cannot cover it up and,
therefore, pretend it is not there. But if that is vice, if that is
‘the smirch on our fair escutcheon,’ then, indeed, must English
prudery be easily offended. It must be a sensitive prudery, for
it cried out against night-clubs, against the Cave of the Golden
Calf, where a few people did drink too much, against the excessive
dancing at poor Ciro’s, which for a time fell among Y.M.C.A.’s.</p>

<p>Also, during the war, a great fuss was raised in the newspapers
over the flappers in the Strand. I do not think anybody would
have bothered much about the flappers if, at that time, we had
not had among us a number of Anzacs who, as everybody knows,
are the gentlest and most guileless of men. These unfortunate
young soldiers, finding themselves lonely in a town such as ours,
where no man needs go lonely along a street if he has a little
determination, lacking all the home comforts which are implied
in the possession of aunts, made their acquaintances where they
could. The flappers in the Strand who, to my knowledge, have
always been in the Strand, particularly on Saturday afternoon
and on Saturday night, when they descend upon Villiers Street
and the bandstand, coming from Aldgate and alighting at
Charing Cross, naturally welcomed them. Now, in the old
days the flappers attached themselves to any young man
they met; sometimes he was a soldier in a red coat, sometimes
just a civilian, and nobody bothered, because in those days it
was not evident that anything unusual existed in the association.
Common sense revealed to all of us that these friendships had
been formed round the bandstand, but nobody was compelled
to know that they did not arise out of engagements of five years’
standing. On the other hand, the Anzacs, with their beautiful
bodies, their bronzed faces and their squash hats, were noticeable;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
a Puritan, after having, in the course of Saturday afternoon, seen
several hundred Anzacs accompanied by pretty girls, was compelled
to realise that there could not be so many Anzacs united
by engagements of five years’ standing, to the flappers in the
Strand. The Puritan hates realising, because when he realises
he has to do something energetic, write to a paper, or form a
committee, or something. He does not mind writing to a paper
or forming a committee, but the whole thing upsets him; he
cannot cover it up, and he runs about with wild eyes, terrified
because the thing which is generally covered up has got loose.</p>

<p>It was that gave rise to the trouble, and the Puritans, determined
that the flappers should flap no more, had to manufacture
a theoretical Anzac, a young man from Melbourne (but born in
the Bush, where no woman had ever been before), a young man
extraordinarily pure in spirit, but liable to fall into temptation
even if he had to cross the road to do so, a young man imbued
by his past education with a profound reverence for womankind,
whose feelings of reverence were daily being outraged by shameless
exhibitions into which he was reluctantly drawn. It’s queer;
this flapper question occupied the Press for months; now and
then the controversy died down, and then a Bishop or a special
article writer brought it up again; agents-general were called
upon to proclaim that our soldiers feared no foe in shining armour
because their heart was pure, while, in the same column, presidents
of watch committees gloomily acknowledged that something
seemed to have happened to the purity of those hearts. But all
agreed that that purity must at once be restored, that the Anzacs,
which includes the Canadians, the South Africans, and other
moral weaklings, must be protected. To this day we are protecting
men of thirty against girls of fifteen: I never heard anybody talk
of protecting the flappers, for it was assumed that, by the time
they were fifteen, they had sunk too deep in iniquity to deserve
better protection than four walls in Holloway. And no one
seems to have asked himself whether these young men, cut away
from old habits, from their friends and their work, did not desperately
want feminine companionship; the members of watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
committees did not ask Colonials to stay with them for the weekend;
for a long time they did not even provide them with sufficient
sleeping places, but seemed to expect them to make merry all
night in the ribald waiting-rooms of Waterloo. Briefly, their
virtue was to be its own reward, and certainly we could not take
from Nietzsche the aphorism that man is for war, woman for the
recreation of the warrior. Above all, we could not let them alone.</p>

<p>Owing to this, my moral sense being aroused by an article
in a Sunday paper, I devoted a Saturday to a search for vice. Of
course, I began in the Strand, where I was told vice reigns. I saw
a great number of soldiers, doubtless viciously employed, but
conducting their debauches with singular restraint and dignity.
Outside the Corner House stood a number of boudoir ladies
from the Government offices, who were deplorably waiting for
omnibuses; many of them may have been viciously employed,
but as their company was mostly confined to their own sex, they
were not sliding very fast down the butter-slide of perdition;
mostly, they were eating chocolates, and the fact that chocolates
then cost four shillings a pound may be sufficient evidence of
undesirable conduct, but this seems to me hardly enough to
hang even a girl on. I proceeded up the Strand where the East
End was slowly beginning to arrive, mostly in twos and threes.
Often, indeed, I met the regrettable flapper; certainly she was
powdered and lip-salved, and I do not know that this is exceptional,
but right up to Temple Bar not a single flapper made an effort
to draw me from the straight path. (It is all very well saying
that I may not be the sort of person whom the flapper would
want to draw from the straight path, but surely vice has no pride,
and stoops to all men.) The most vicious thing I saw was two
soldiers and two girls walking rudely arm in arm.</p>

<p>I did my best. Indeed, I think I became a regular <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agent
provocateur</i>, but I did not seem able to provoke anybody. So,
desperately, I turned back and crossed the river towards Waterloo
Road. The reputation of this gray and green commercial track
was made by the street arab in <i>Captain Brassbound’s Conversion</i>,
who declared that if he did in Morocco the things he did in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Waterloo Road he would be hanged. But nothing was happening
in Waterloo Road; many people were drinking in many public-houses;
I entered a few public-houses, and though I tried as
hard as the two houses of convocation put together, I found
nothing. I will not weary you with details; it is enough to say
that, still guided by my Sunday newspaper, I proceeded on my
footsore search. By evening, I was lurking round Victoria,
watching from the corner of my eyes for the harpies who drug
veteran members of the Band of Hope, and after I had loafed about
for a while, no doubt I must have conveyed a harpy-like suggestion;
I was seen in a picture palace, peering into the dimness of the
curtained boxes, which was easy, as they were not dim. That
night I was seen in many places, searching the blackness of railway
arches, furtively peering down the staircases of tubes, hoping to
discover the worst; I appeared in the deserted City; the back
streets of Theobald’s Road, the confidences of a hall porter in
Gerrard Street (expensive and uneventful), a long inspection of
the first floor fronts of Vauxhall Bridge Road, seen from the top
of a tram, all these grew familiar to me; and still nothing. As
time went on, my legs grew more and more woolly; my mind so
obsessed and incoherent, that I realised time would soon fit me
for membership of the National Vigilance Society. I even entered
the Leicester Lounge, where there was hardly anybody, as it
was not Boat Race night; then I wondered whether a visit to
North Bank, St John’s Wood ... and awoke from my trance,
remembering that this would be thirty years late. There is no
vice in London; at least, there is nothing deliberate and artistic,
just as there is very little in Paris or Vienna that would justify a
Welsh elder in taking so long a journey. It is a pity that so fair
a bubble should be pricked.</p>

<p>This does not mean that London is a magnified Exeter Hall.
There are, in this town, about half a million bachelors, and that
is enough to lower the moral status of any city. There are also
rather more married men, which does not mend matters. Observe
the bias of my mind: I have forgotten to tell you the number,
frequently quoted by indignant letter writers to the Press, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
women who hold forth temptation. For it may be true that supply
assists demand, but it is much more certain that demand makes
supply. During the war, for instance, there was great agitation in the
Upper House of Convocation, where the Bishop of London
revealed that in Cayeux and Havre undesirable houses were frequented
by British troops. Canon Burroughs went on to ask for
purity patrols, while the Bishop of Oxford presented a resolution
designed to protect our troops from molestation in London.
This is all very well, and deserves all sympathy, but the Bishop
of London unfortunately read out a protest addressed to the
Mayor of the French town by its inhabitants, and this protest
referred to ‘crowds of English soldiers waiting outside the houses.’
Does one, then, wait for temptation? Does not temptation steal
upon one as a thief in the night, or as a raging lion, seeking whom
it may devour? It is a picturesque idea this, of crowds of innocent
victims impatiently waiting for an opportunity to degrade their
eternal spirit.</p>

<p>Temptation is nonsense. I have spoken to many men about
temptation; they are seldom tempted, and this for very good
reasons: men do not fall, they dive. The women who ‘prey on
them,’ fulfil a function which will be necessary so long as society
is as vilely constituted as it is, so long as life is hard and insecure,
so long as social relations are false, so long as marriage is expensive
and difficult of dissolution, and, especially, so long as the hearts of
men are brutish and the hearts of women soft. The class which
for centuries has been hunted, has for centuries been maintained
by the hunter, just as the fox is bred and protected for the pleasure
of the chase. Those women do not seem to me to lead as easy
lives as the men who profit by their weakness; they look rather
less well-fed, less well-clad; they wear gold of a lesser carat;
when they die their names do not appear in the newspapers under
the final advertisement: ‘To-day’s wills.’ Truly, the wages of
sin are low. Should we not conclude that if bread is so dear, and
flesh and blood cheap, there is no great inducement for the sale
of flesh and blood, except the cost of bread? Perhaps it is the
easiest way, but only for those to whom all ways would be easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
There is no remedy for what the social campaigners call the
condition of our streets, except an alteration in the mind of the
men who walk in them; Christianity cannot help, for Christianity
attempts to solve this problem by purging sin, instead of realising
misfortune. Thus too many Christians justify Tacitus: ‘After
the burning of Rome, suspicion fell on the Emperor. In order
to allay them, the Emperor embarked on a series of persecutions;
among those he persecuted was a sect that called themselves
Christians, who had incurred the animosity of the populace owing
to their sullen hatred of mankind.’</p>

<p>Tacitus was wrong, but then he was judging the Christians
of his day as agitators. The streets will alter when the houses
along the streets alter, when mankind has found love in the mind,
when it is no longer content with the love of the body. The
majority of men seem to approach life as pigs do the trough.
Visit a West End restaurant, and you will be sure. In that trough
are not only curds and whey, and truffles, and other suitable
dainties; but excessive clothes and jewellery, honours, false social
values, irrelevant powers; so long as the Gadarene crowd
nuzzle and fight about that trough, so long will many of those,
who are not Gadarene in the spirit, be infected with envy and
desire, so long will they be driven to shrillness and self-advertisement,
so long drawn by popularity and repelled by fame. Meanwhile,
it naturally follows that what many call vice should endure,
for vice is the satisfaction that dulls the flesh when the spirit
aches. Happy men have no vices; it is only the unhappy, the
hungry, fly to them. For my part, if I had to make laws for a
new society, I would make few. I should say rather that we
will build our new society so that all may be assured security and
justice, but no more. If we were to establish justice, we should
automatically do away with the curse of the world, which is wealth.
It might be a pity. It may be that Anatole France is right when
he says: ‘The devil dead, good-bye sin. Maybe beauty, this
ally of the devil, will vanish with him. Maybe that we shall not
again see the flowers that intoxicate, and the eyes that slay.’ Still,
one would like to see it tried.</p>

<h2 class="chapheadleft">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE POOR</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Not</span> much more than a dozen years ago, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
startled England by stating that thirteen million of
our people stood, at all times, on the edge of starvation. He took
as a basis the study of the condition of the poor, made by Mr
Charles Booth in a great number of volumes, containing a great
number of columns of figures, and was alluding in general to the
large class that existed on a family income of twenty-three shillings
a week. There was something terrible about those figures, so
terrible that even the press was shocked. But there was something
uninspired and inhuman about Mr Booth’s columns of figures;
it is all very well telling us that so many thousands of people live
five in a room, and so many thousands six in a room, and so on,
but it does not mean anything. The ordinary man finds it almost
as difficult to imagine that kind of life as to visualise a million;
he can see six people in a room, but his mind does not bring up
the idea of those six people in material attitudes, sleeping, eating,
courting, making merry; figures create no microcosm. I suspect
that to understand the poor, a little, you need to know very well
the places where the poor live. The house is a fairly clear indication
of the inhabitant; it is the house he chose, or the house to
which he submitted. Then who is this poor man? this poor man
round whom so many essays have been written? by the Fabian
Society, judicial; by the Charity Organisation Society, severe;
by Mr John Galsworthy, understanding and tender? The poor man
is of the same genus as the rich man, but of a different species.
(I mean the born poor man as opposed to the born rich man.)
The rich man is no better than the poor man; the poor man is no
better than the rich man; they are different creatures, made such
by different conditions, just as a Spaniard and a Lancastrian are
made different by their various lives. Only, and there’s the
political rub, Englishmen have not to administer the affairs of
Spaniards, while they do have to administer the affairs of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
own poor; thus it is important that they should not blunder,
because the poor are not good at improving conditions; their
attitude is to grin and bear, and then, one day, to cease to bear.</p>

<p>To understand them at all one must take an imaginative leap;
if you find this difficult, Mr John Galsworthy has taken it admirably
in <i>The Freelands</i>. Listen to his description of a labourer’s
<span class="locked">life:—</span></p>

<p>‘He gets up summer and winter ... out of a bed that he
cannot afford time or money to keep too clean or warm, in a small
room that probably has not a large enough window; into clothes
stiff with work, and boots stiff with clay; makes something hot
for himself, very likely brings some of it to his wife and children;
goes out, attending to his digestion crudely and without comfort;
works with his hands and feet from half-past six or seven in the
morning till past five at night, except that twice he stops for an
hour or so and eats simple things that he would not altogether
have chosen to eat, if he could have had his will. He goes home to
a tea that has been got ready for him, and has a clean-up without
assistance, smokes a pipe of shag, reads a newspaper perhaps two
days old, and goes out again to work for his own good, in his
vegetable patch, or to sit on a wooden bench in an atmosphere of
beer and “baccy.” And so, dead tired, but not from directing
other people, he drowses himself to early lying again in his doubtful
bed.’</p>

<p>One should read, as a contrast, Mr Galsworthy’s description
of the rich man he calls <span class="locked">Malloring:—</span></p>

<p>‘Your Malloring is called with a cup of tea, at, say, seven
o’clock, out of a nice, clean, warm bed; he gets into a bath that
has been got ready for him; into clothes and boots that have
been brushed for him; and goes down to a room where there’s a
fire burning already if it’s a cold day, writes a few letters, perhaps,
before eating a breakfast of exactly what he likes, nicely prepared
for him, and reading the newspaper that best comforts his soul;
when he has eaten and read, he lights his cigar or his pipe, and
attends to his digestion in the most sanitary and comfortable
fashion; then in his study he sits down to the steady direction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
other people, either by interview or by writing letters, or what
not. In this way, between directing people and eating what he
likes, he passes the whole day, except that for two or three hours,
sometimes indeed seven or eight hours, he attends to his physique
by riding, motoring, playing a game, or indulging in a sport that
he has chosen for himself. And, at the end of all that, he probably
has another bath that has been made ready for him, puts on clean
clothes that have been put out for him, goes down to a good dinner
that has been cooked for him, smokes, reads, learns, and inwardly
digests, or else plays cards, billiards, and acts host until he is
sleepy, and so to bed, in a clean, warm bed, in a clean, fresh
room.’</p>

<p>I challenge you to say that this is exaggerated. If you like,
say you don’t care; but don’t say it isn’t true. And I will not
preach at you, but suggest, to such as detect in me sentimentality,
that if we belong to a refined and gifted class into whose hands
the world has been given, if, indeed, we are refined and gifted
people, a condition such as that of the poor man should offend
our æsthetic sense. I have known a rather larger number of
poor men than is usual in my class; I have not known them very
well, because the worst of the difference between the rich and the
poor is that the poor cannot trust the rich; they know them too
well. The poor know that the rich conduct against them the
class-war, and so they are defensive, inclined either to say the
thing that will procure a tip, or a post as office-boy for little Tommy,
or they will turn savagely on you to show you they are as good as
you, and tell you that though margarine is good enough for you,
their inborn good taste makes it impossible for them to consume
anything but the best butter. One does not get together, any
more than that Spaniard and that Lancastrian would get together,
after five years of Ollendorff. Still, if one passionately wants to
understand, one sometimes, for a moment, perceives the shadow
of a hint of what another creature is. I remember perceiving it,
for the first time, in the midst of an alien family in Widegate Street,
just off Petticoat Lane; I had been sent by the firm who employed
me to make searching inquiries and to dispense small bounties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
My aliens were, I think, German Jews, who called themselves
Russian refugees because it sounded more appealing; they were
not a pleasant crowd; the man was a great, big, heavy, fat fellow,
with greasy, black hair, a rather surly brigand; there was a woman,
too, lying in a corner, dirtier than the man, presumably because
she had been lying there for some time; there were four little
children, exceedingly fat and well kept, the usual mystery of
Jewish poverty; there was an extraordinarily old woman who
sat next to the woman on the floor, and from the beginning to
the end of the interview said not a word and moved not a feature.
But the horror of it came from the woman on the floor, who also
said not a word: there was no furniture in the room, not a table,
not a chair, not even a bed; the woman lay on a few crumpled
newspapers ... and had, the night before, given birth to a
child, who lay naked between her indescribably filthy bodice and
her breast. They were there, all together, in the midst of life,
left and abandoned, hungrily desirous of the moment when the
great industrial machine of London would be ready to consume
them. Impostors, perhaps, but if so, hard is the way of imposture
and slender the wages thereof.</p>

<p>I remember thinking, after that, as I went along Petticoat
Lane, that is become Middlesex Street, how much the district
resembled the people. There is no Petticoat Lane now; Middlesex
Street holds nothing picturesque or national; even its open-air
market on Sunday morning can be paralleled by any Saturday
afternoon scene in the little streets of Edgware Road, or in
Walker’s Court, Soho. It is a street mainly of warehouses;
Widegate Street and Sandys Row exhibit the oddity of narrow
crookedness and no more. Petticoat Lane, where the shops are
paltry, and the folk divide into too fat and too lean, is not even a
mean street. Its one charm is the prevalent, handsome young
Jewess, aged about fourteen, with high tasselled boots, and plenty
of silk stocking, containing plenty of leg. She is a fine girl; she
haunts you all along Whitechapel Road, and so to Mile End, with
her rude air of wealth and wealth-consciousness. I don’t know
how she does it; with very little money, some crude colour and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
some light furs, she suggests opulence. There is something
matronly about her, too; she looks so marriageable ... and
when one looks into the humid softness of her brown eyes, one
finds a limitless rectitude of morals, which may arise from a limitless
power to resist temptation.</p>

<p>Her thick mouth is tight closed; her stays are tight; her
mind is tight. She is fair and square, and will give her husband
value for his money, but somehow one feels it a pity that all she
will give him is value.</p>

<p>Those girls are part of a certain reckless gaiety that pervades
Whitechapel. I like Whitechapel Road; the streets that run
off it are indeed tragic with dirt and desolation, but the road
itself, which is the pleasure-house of the inhabitants, is full of
vitality. At all times it is thickly peopled, mostly with foreign
Jews of all types, many of them scrubby little men with beards,
who gesticulate in groups at street corners, and argue with their
co-religionists. Some are in a state of offensive prosperity.
Those Jewish crowds are more alive than the average
London crowd; their eyes shine more, as if they were
more capable of conceiving desire. They are at their most intense
before the many open-air stalls, where you may buy boots and
clothing, flowers, toys, and books, and music, and furniture, and
every food you know, and some you do not; and teasers for ladies,
and surprises for gents, and penny boxes of tricks that will make
you popular at a social evening, and collections of jokes of ancient
lineage. It is a wonderful show; it is, in many ways, more
wonderful than Williamson’s Bonanza in the Brixton Road,
because it is cheaper, because a penny goes farther, and thus the
penn’orth is more hotly desired. All that points to another side
of the poor, the side Mr Galsworthy never sees: their joys.</p>

<p>It is true that the joyous side of poverty is much less evident
than the unhappy side; this because the pleasures of the poor
are either localised within their own homes (instead of outcropping
in restaurants), or because they are confined every year to a limited
number of delirious days. Also, the places in which they live are
mostly so abominable that it is difficult for men of our sort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
understand that delight may dwell in a slum a little more easily,
and a little longer than love in a cottage.</p>

<p>The slums are so evident to our eyes; they are everywhere.
For instance, there is an unexpected little slum in the middle of
Mayfair, round Shepherd Market and Shepherd Street. I believe
the whole place is insanitary and should be pulled down (I have
no love for the picturesque). It is surprising to think that the
inhabitants of Mayfair must now and then go through the little,
cramped market with the small, dirty houses, yet fail to discover
that here, between Curzon Street and Piccadilly, stands a knot of
public-houses at one of which, perhaps, Sam Weller was asked to
take part in a swarry of boiled mutton; the hypothetical investigator
from Grosvenor Square would be surprised to find out that here
one can buy a shirt for 3s. 6d., sweets by the ounce, underclothes
for 2s. 11d., and that for 2d. a hungry man can purchase a meat
pie. It is like that all over London, in Belgravia, in Marylebone,
just as in St Giles’s. They have not quite slain St Giles’s, the
street-improvers, and there still is charm in Seven Dials, where
once seven little public-houses stood at seven little corners, and
each public-house had a dial. You told the time by tossing up or
averaging. And now there is but one dial left, and it has lost its
hands. (Hush, my soul! Do not let the spirit of Mr E. V. Lucas
invade thee.)</p>

SHEPHERD’S MARKET<br />

<p>There is more truth in the frank slums over the river. I once
enjoyed the services of a supernumerary postman, who frequently
came to my house to make experiments on the garden, to put up
shelves, to interfere with the gas, or to drown kittens. In the
end he went too far, for he attempted to cure the ball-cock of some
obscure disease, and it responded to his treatment by flooding
the kitchen three feet deep. But before that tragic day (you
should have seen my cat swim), I visited him in Rotherhithe,
because, among his many supernumerary trades, he numbered that
of vine grower. Against the back of his house in West Lane he
had, indeed, managed to grow a splendid, muscular-looking vine,
which produced great quantities of grapes; these grapes, when
eaten, reproduced what is probably the flavour of vitriol, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
was very proud of them, and ate them, and he kept his vine in
condition by occasionally watering its roots with a bucket of
bullock’s blood. He received this free, because he kept the
slaughterer’s books in his spare time. But all this is by the way,
and there are many respectable old gentlemen who do all these
things and are thought none the worse of; as everybody knows,
lunacy in the poor is originality in the rich. What was interesting
about the supernumerary’s home was the breadth of West Lane,
that is really a dingy square of bare earth planted with trees whose
every sooty leaf whispers: ‘Oh! had I the wings of a dove!’ It is
a square of crumbling Georgian frontages not devoid of a certain
splendour. That discovery is one of the keys to the condition of
the poor. You find this not only in Rotherhithe, but in Clapham,
in Brixton, in the New Kent Road; here and there, behind the
board of a photographer, where are exposed pictures of young
men with all their hair brushed off their foreheads, and of young
girls with all their hair brushed into their eyes, you see a beautiful
old house with a porch of the Adams type. Many of these streets,
such as Old Kent Road, such as Tooley Street, have become
wholly commercial, have turned into long lines of gray warehouses
and decaying side streets, haunted by many children; some,
like Jamaica Road, and most of Bermondsey, have entirely fallen
into the hands of the grayest commerce, but here and there you
are bound to find a still splendid Georgian house, looking rather
like a distressed Irish lady, who does her best to keep her transformation
combed, and to maintain the traditions of the Ballymullins
of County Mayo. These houses are in the hands of the poor,
which means that, originally intended for prosperous people
with several servants, they have been cut up into tenements; this
also means that the stairs have not been mended since the days of
William IV.; that Queen Victoria came to the throne, and married
and mourned, that Disraeli passed reform bills while no bathrooms
were put in; that the tap went on running in the backyard,
where Georgian wealth used to fill the jugs; it means that
the old house has lost most of its glass, and is running with mice
and stinking with beetles; that the drains have been left by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
local to a higher authority. Part of the tragedy of the poor is
that few houses have been built for them, and that they have to
adapt themselves to houses discarded by the rich, which are not
meant for them, which are not usable by them. The rooms are so
large that the poor cannot afford them unless they overcrowd
them; or they have tiny windows because they were
limited by the old window tax. There is only one thing to
do for them, as is the case with most institutions: blow them
up.</p>

<p>Will the superman be bred by the L.C.C.? I do not know,
but I am sure that the superman will not be bred in any numbers
in the middle of the stench of the past. Evil and old are almost
synonyms, and I confess that I like better the vulgarity of the
suburban street, with its concrete that pretends to be stone, and
its plaster beams that pretend to be wood, its wooden pillars
that pretend to be marble. I like it better, with its bay windows,
so built that no article of furniture will fit it, with its awful ingle
nooks, its sham gables and its sham dormer windows, than the
awful old Georgian houses near Lamb’s Conduit Street, where,
crowded together under a ceiling still flecked with gold, on which
naked cherubs sprawl, a dozen Russian furriers sit and scratch.
For the hideous modern house can at least be clean; it is small;
it is washable; a through draught can be arranged; a very little
it opens the window on life.</p>

<p>In the sense of housing we have never housed our poor;
hardly anywhere, up to 1900 or so, have we done anything but
run up rude brick boxes as shelters, or adapt the dwellings of
the rich. Hence, I believe, a stricken, scrofulous generation.
Yes, I know there is a charm about all this black filth, as if, indeed,
flowers did sprout from dunghills. It is the charm of contrast,
it is singularity. You feel it in every poor region. You feel it at
the Elephant and Castle, for instance, though why the Elephant
should alone be famous, while at the two opposite corners sit the
Rockingham and Alfred’s Head, equally great public-houses,
I do not know; you feel it in the rowdiness of London Road,
and in a sort of ‘none-of-your-lip’ air that hangs over Newington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Causeway. You feel it still more in Deptford; indeed, Deptford
is a pitiful place, all gray stone and gray slate, but the smell of the
sea hangs about it, and as it lies along the docks, often above these
slate roofs, above the timber stacks of strange wood, you see the
tangled masts and cranes cut out against the sky, patterns evidently
designed by Nevinson. I remember once seeing on the shoulder
of an old woman who kept a stationer’s shop, a gorgeous parrot.
It had a yellow and blue body, scarlet feathers in its tail, a bill of
ebony, and eyes like molten gold. It sat on her shoulder, thinking
of things old as the willow pattern. The parrot looked out upon
Deptford High Street, through the flaming topaz of its eyes at
the young men who passed now and then, sun-burnt starvelings
of the merchant service, in blue jerseys; the sailors rolled and
the parrot thought, and in the heat the East breathed from the
logs of mahogany and sandalwood. But under all that, under all
that theatrical charm was buried the same old thing, the bad old
house made to fit the bad new time.</p>

<p>Yet, the poor are not as unhappy as they look. They do not,
in the accepted sense, live a life of pleasure, but to say that they
have no pleasures, or can have none because they are poor, is a
mistake. The poor have cheap pleasures, pleasures which many
of us do not care for, and they take no part in what we choose to
call pleasures. If I were compelled to say something sweeping,
I should say that the rich have less pleasures than the poor; they
are free from more pains, but that is not the same thing. The
pleasures of the poor reside much more than do ours in animal
comforts; whereas the rich take a good dinner and its wines as
a matter of course, the poor make a feast of a joint or a gallon of
beer. Things such as these, food, drink, warmth, second-class
travelling, arm-chairs, extra blankets, translate themselves, not
into the mere satisfaction of needs, but into recognisable pleasures.
It is so in the whole field of their amusements, the cinema, the
music-hall, the football and cricket fields, where many watch
matches, and a few play them; it is so in regard to bank holidays,
to journeys to Southend or Margate, to bathing, to visiting the
Chamber of Horrors, to being photographed. All these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
matter more to the poor than they do to the rich, and you will
realise that this is true, if you recall that you have never met an
underpaid clerk or a working girl who did not passionately look
forward to holidays. On the other hand, you are all familiar
with the state of mind of a well-to-do family, who solemnly discuss
one May evening, ‘Where shall we go in August?’ When the
poor discuss where they shall go to in August, and most of them
mean on August Bank Holiday, they do not come together in the
spirit of profound misery and grim hostility that characterises
the respectable classes. They do not go away because they must
go away in August, nor must they go away in August because
everybody goes away in August: it costs them something to go
away. The holiday is a treat, and is not a part of the household
budget estimated for in every income. I need not stress this,
but we all know that when estimates are prepared one must put
in rent, rates, taxes, doctor, dentist, chemist ... <em>holidays</em>.
That is not pleasure. But it is pleasure when Alf tells Ethel that
he has had a rise, and that they can this year rise to Cromer instead
of Ramsgate. The difference is still more remarkable if we recall
the ‘thank-God-that’s-over’ attitude of the rich when, at last, their
holiday is done, and the beneficent train pants into Paddington or
Victoria. I have known many poor young men and women, and
never met one who had not enjoyed a perfect holiday. I have met
some who had passed seven days in a mackintosh, and even then
had enjoyed a perfect holiday.</p>

<p>The poor have pleasures, because they draw more than we
can from pleasures; they anticipate more, because they are less
spoilt by the experience of pleasures, and have not yet found out
that these have mutable faces. To make their good fortune more
complete, they are even capable of anticipating pleasure without
being disappointed when they attain it. Their pleasures are
keen, because they are rare. They are keen, because they obtain
very little pleasure without paying for it, and as they have little
money they must scheme, plan, save; so pleasure becomes a
thing to strive for, a true reward; they have to climb the fig tree
to secure the figs; they are not cursed with the ownership of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
fig tree, cannot lie under its boughs until a ripe fig drops into
their mouth.</p>

<p>We must not forget, too, that poverty has psychological
reactions. Mr Bernard Shaw says that poverty is a disgusting
disease, and, on the whole, he is right, but the sufferer has marvellous
moments of recovery. In those moments the poor man
does what the rich man, by long education, has been taught not
to do: he lets himself go. He can hold arms with half a dozen
companions and proceed uproariously along a pier, singing
abominably an excellent music-hall tune, to the inefficient accompaniment
of a concertina or mouth-organ; he can reel out of
public-houses in a state of complete indifference to public opinion,
instead of being secreted by the club waiter and paternally controlled
by a taxi-driver; indeed, the poor man can derive much vanity
from his condition, and rise in the esteem of his fellows next day,
because he took part in such a spree. (In this country, if you
can’t be great, be drunk.) Above all, he can make love in public.
He can, unashamedly, sit upon a bench in the park, complicatedly
intertwined with his beloved, sometimes with two beloveds;
nobody minds, and the little god of love will, for a moment, blind
the policeman’s bull’s eye. He needs no Sussex down, nor footmen,
nor thermos flasks, to make a picnic; with the <i>Daily Mirror</i> beneath
the bough, a flask of ginger beer, and her beside him singing,
‘Who were you with Last Night?’ Battersea Park is Paradise
enow.</p>

<p>Their social functions, too, are more social, and less functional.
They do not, in our sense, entertain, that is to say they do not, at
given intervals, go through their address book and say: ‘We
can’t ask Lady So-and-So, because she has refused our last two
invitations, and I suppose we must ask the Fitz-Thompsons.
Or do you think we could get out of it?’ No, they don’t entertain;
they prefer to be entertained, and so, on strictly scheduled occasions,
namely, Christmas, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and engagements,
<em>and on no others</em>, the whole family and a few very old friends
are asked to a spread. And it <em>is</em> a spread. It is not compulsory
jellies from Gunter’s, or game pie from the Café Royal, or, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
worse, a dinner no better than every day’s dinner, but merely a
little longer; it is a real spread comprising three times the food
that is normally eaten, choice food, such as tinned salmon, lobster,
trifle with real brandy, stuffed loin of pork, likely to be remembered.
If there is wine it is port wine, the real article. The real article
and not the rotten routine. So the people they bring together
are not the frigid crowd we call acquaintances, whom most of us
ask because they have asked us, or because they threaten to do so,
people whom we do not know very well and whom we don’t want
to know very well, people, therefore, on whom our display cannot
make a great impression. The poor ask the people they know well,
people who know their exact income. Thus they attain a great
human pleasure: ostentation. The life of the poor is harsh, but
their joys are keen. I used to know a woman who called them the
poor poor. What a fool she was!</p>

<span class="subhead">STONES</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A critical</span> foreigner, whose impressions of London I collected,
(a thing one does to foreigners because that at least is common
ground), gave words to the usual complaint of the Continental:
London was a mean-looking city; its bricks were dirty; it used
so little stone; lacked we stone? And the buildings were low.
And some stuck out beyond the common frontage, while some
set back. And so on, the whole served with the usual sauce made
up mainly of respect for our practical spirit and our commercial
success, the things we are not proud of because, indeed, they are
ours.</p>

<p>Almost every foreigner has that impression of London, and
he mistakes the spirit of our city so much that, to restore him,
one has to show him typical American architecture such as
Selfridge’s, Kingsway, or older buildings of greater majesty,
such as the Quadrant or the terraces round Regent’s Park. Failing
stone, we exhibit stucco, and the intelligent foreigner discerns no
irony in the epigram on <span class="locked">Nash:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘Augustus, at Rome, was for building renowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of marble he left what of brick he had found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is not our Nash, too, a very great master?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds us all brick and he leaves us all plaster.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now stucco is an unfairly scorned material; it produces a
pleasantly smooth surface, which weathers to creamy-olive, and,
indeed, its only crime is that it conceals brick. Brick and tile are
two of our most delightful materials; people do wrong to sneer at
them just because poor cottages are so built. Red brick, when
not too large, such as the delightful little Tudor brick, is smiling
and domestic. The progress of building has, in this case, proved
a retrogress for art. Nowadays, the big red bricks are so angular,
so perfectly cemented that most blocks of flats approximate to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
workhouses, while the yellow brick now current should be reserved
for public buildings of special distinction, such as national
memorials and academies of painting. But the little red brick
that you could hold in your hand, the irregular lines of which
bespoke a temperament, which fitted tenderly into patchy cement,
as an almond of alabaster into the green velvet of its sheath, was
quite another kind of stone. Still, we must take our stones as
we find them, and I do not agree with the intelligent foreigner
who thinks London a mean city. Many of us find the fine
Continental cities, such as new Paris, new Barcelona, and new
Frankfurt, as painful to live in as might be the Agricultural Hall.
The houses are too high, their flanks too white, their alignment
dull as a righteous life. When one considers towns like New York,
one wonders how the inhabitant finds his way home. By scent,
I suppose, for little can his eyes help him among those vast
buildings, all alike.</p>

<p>In London, few streets and not many squares are alike. The
detestable institution of the leasehold has had this good result, that
few ground landlords in central London have built the houses
they own. They have merely imposed upon the leaseholder the
obligation to build a good house worth so much. As a result,
the leaseholder has built what he fancied, and, therefore, London
is not the result of the schemes of some horrid central office, but
of the oddities and taste of thousands of men. That is why
our sky-line is so broken, why, in Berkeley Square, we find
two charming little, narrow houses close to a tall block of flats;
that is why, in Oxford Street, tottering little shops, built under
William IV., hug the Tube Station and its monster hotel.
Variety is the salt of London life.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>Where London has, to a certain extent, abandoned variety,
and that to good purpose, is in the squares. London, more than
any in the world, is a city of squares; a feudal remnant has there
set most of the important houses, while those of the vassals were
placed in the side streets, and those of the churls in the mews.
The squares imply social classifications, and though many of
them, such as Golden Square, Soho Square, Regent Square, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
fallen into the hands of the poor or of commerce, they all began
by being centres of polite society. To this day there is something
in a square that no other thoroughfare has; a sort of measured
enclosedness, a finished privacy. The garden in the middle that
none enter save lovers and cats, a garden sometimes sooty, sometimes
kept trim by a gardener born old, is cut off from the rough
movement of the city. Those who have been interested enough
to penetrate into the green part of Cavendish Square or Craven
Hill Gardens, will know that there one is as truly lost as in any
lane of West Anglia. Those green spots are almost untrodden,
and, to all visitors, are virginal. The impression of privacy
extends also to the houses; though these may differ they do not
vastly do so. The contrasts between them are those which appear
among the members of a family. All are, to a certain extent,
traditional, and it is mainly in the squares that you find remnants
of Georgian London.</p>

<p>Most of Georgian London has fallen into the hands of the
tenement maker, because the people of the Georgian period built
in districts now populous, such as Clapham, Highbury, Soho,
Chalk Farm, because the leases were long and the houses good
enough to make it unbusinesslike to pull them down. Still, some
Georgian London, and especially some London of William IV.,
has preserved its old, flat face, sober and dignified, yet has been
modernised, internally, by anachronistic organs such as the bathroom,
the telephone, electric light. Those houses are delightful,
for the adventure of the present has purged them of the sins of the
past. Such houses as the one now tenanted by Messrs Thornton
Smith, in Soho Square, the small houses with the Adams doorways
that make up the Adelphi, the slim exquisiteness of Westminster
in Barton Street or North Street, all these, by their very form,
suggest that inside all is order and courtesy. Those houses were
built when land was cheap, when we did not need to pile Smith
upon Jones and call the result Cornucopia Court, or what not;
in those days they did not need to store coal in the pantry, and,
for historic reasons, they did not combine the bathroom with the
kitchens. Still, these are only survivals, and though the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
William Willett did what he could near Avenue Road to restore
the Georges under an Edward, the Georgian house is dead. It
is too large; it leaves aside the servant problem; its rooms are
too square, difficult to light, difficult to furnish in a period when
furniture is small and tortured in design. It is almost as dead
as the Elizabethan house, which is only a curiosity.</p>

<p>People still talk of Cloth Fair, but if you go to Smithfield you
will find no Cloth Fair now, only a dirty little back street, not at
all the scenery which Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree would have
thought suitable for the entry of Bolingbroke into London. If
you are wise, you will at once step back farther into the past and
enter St Bartholomew’s, where arches and pillars, broad and solid
as those of hell, will make you understand the Mosaic quality of
the Christian faith. In St Bartholomew’s, that is black and
dispassionate, dwells no gentle Redeemer, but the spirit of the
Lord of Hosts.</p>

<p>True, there is Crosby Hall, though it is hard to shake off the
connection between Crosby Hall and chops, for I knew it best in
the days when, there, one ate chops (and sirloin, yes, sirloin). In
those days, in the City, Crosby Hall was really an Elizabethan
place, a mullioned old house, with sunken beams. For most of
the day it held people who ate a great deal, drank a great deal,
and bellowed, and played billiards, and flirted with the waitresses,
and made bets, and told undesirable stories. Yes, it was real
Shakespeare, all the time. But one day they pulled down Crosby
Hall and re-erected it in Chelsea, near the end of Oakley Street;
the last time I went in they were holding an exhibition of arts and
crafts, which proved that leather might be compelled to assume
many forms it didn’t like. I never saw it again. Then there is
St Ethelburga, the little wooden church in Bishopsgate, which
takes, I believe, a special interest in seamen. A pleasant little
church, for there is something very human and pre-Fire in its
having let off its frontage to an optician. (I wonder whether the
optician and the incumbent both labour under the motto of
Usebius.)</p>

<p>But if Georgian London has left so little, and Elizabethan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
London hardly anything, it is not so of the Victorian period, which
still hangs over most of the city like the shadow of a great tree
which will not let the flowers grow. Nearly all the houses in
central London are Victorian; most are early Victorian, because
the building rush in the ’eighties and ’nineties affected mainly
the suburbs, where a ribald æstheticism combined with the
discovery of the quaint by Charles Dickens. Now the Victorian
period was neither picturesque nor quaint; it looked upon that
sort of thing as indecent. It liked a plain house for a plain man,
and the Victorian man got his house. In another fifty years or
so, when time has done with the houses of the ’sixties, on their
tombstone shall be inscribed: ‘Eight steps and a brass knocker,
such are the wages of virtue.’ Some think that too much evil is
spoken of the Victorian period, and that much that was solid,
sound, truly English came to fruition in those days. For my
part, I think that the Victorian period was nothing but a bad
dream, that the English are essentially the people who drank
sack, and danced round the maypole, just as now they drink beer
and go to the cinema. The English are a pleasure-loving people,
an emotional, perhaps a hysterical people; they are gay, improvident,
thriftless, adventurous, reckless people; there is little to
pick between them and the Neapolitans. Yes, there has been a
lot of respectability and talk of carriage folk, and heavy sideboards,
and being shocked, and all that sort of thing; but I submit that
English history extends farther back than 1830, that there were
happy days before the English grew oppressed with their new
respectability, which arose slowly out of the sudden growth of
wealth among numbers of ill-educated people. Before the ’thirties
there were only two kinds of people: those who did what they were
told, and those who did what they liked. The factory had begun
to take shape in 1770; towards 1830 occurred the rise, all over
the Midlands and North, of small workshops that became mills.
This turned some members of the working class into capitalists.
As the workshops grew, the working class population grew
round them and formed towns. To serve the needs of these
towns shops arose; these became prosperous, and produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
another fairly rich class, the shopkeeping class. From the ’sixties
onwards, the workshops, warehouses, and shops grew so much
that those who, once upon a time, were scriveners, became managers
and agents. This produced a third class of ill-educated people
endowed with some money.</p>

<p>The result was soon felt: we had created the middle class,
and as, in those days, the middle class was still conscious of the
upper class, realised itself as lowly bred, it concluded that the
only way of living up to its new money was to be more moral and
especially more refined than either the upper class or the lower
class. That is the origin of the red damask curtains, of the English
Sunday (which once upon a time was debauched and delicious),
of wax fruit, tall hats, black silk, jet, and such like horrors.</p>

<p>But is that the end? No. Round about 1890, the middle
class having made still more money, having split itself up into
upper middle class and lower middle class, having sent its sons
to the public schools and universities, its daughters to Brussels
or Dresden, began swiftly <em>to slough off the old virtues which it no
longer needed</em>. The daughters went to dances under slender
chaperonage; some of them became Fabians; red paper was
scraped off and replaced by brown; Jacobean furniture came in;
respectable people began to dine at hotels and, what was much
more fatal, to lunch at restaurants. Bridge came in ... cigarettes
crept in. I do not say the middle class is dead, but when you are
tempted to think that the Victorian period represented, in English
history, anything but an accident, anything but the formulation
of a class, then consider most of your young acquaintances, and
ask yourself, honestly, whether those very people, fifty years ago,
would not have gone to funerals with weepers tied round their
hats. To-day, there is a continuous impulse in the middle class
to grow smart, fast, intellectual, all that. Call this progress or call
it decay, never mind; I submit that it exhibits Victorian respectability
as merely a stage in the development of English people,
and that we are tending towards a time when the jolly 1780’s will
live again with something hectic and abandoned thrown in. The
English people are a light people, a gay people, and the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
period 1830–1880 was, after all, a short period in the eight hundred
years odd which separate us from the Conqueror. It was a period
of reconstruction, and the English emerged from it as new English,
not very different from the old English. We have digested our
money; of course, England was sleepy while she did that; those
who believe that that sleep was natural to her suffer from illusion.
Now she has begun to spend the resultant energy. Bustles,
daguerreotypes, Sunday rest, and whiskers, Pecksniff will find
all that in another region.</p>

<p>Pecksniff will also, at least I hope so, if he is to be happy,
find the Victorian house. It was not a bad house inside, in spite
of its vast, incoherent basement, the ell at the back of the drawing-room,
and the shameful servants’ bedrooms; it was a roomy
house, but there was too much in it for the cockroach and the
mouse. Most of Bayswater, Paddington, Kensington, and
Marylebone, are Victorian; all depend upon slave labour. Few
of those houses can be managed properly on less than three servants;
some are still run by one servant assisted by the young ladies, who
do the dusting, but the importance of the point lies in this: with
one servant they are dirtily run; with two servants they are barely
run. They are full of corners, corridors, cupboards; they collect
dust, and eat up light. In days when flesh and blood was cheap,
when you could easily get young girls to wear the skin off their
knees on the steps, the edifice stood up pretty well. But those
days are gone; the servant problem is partly due to the Victorian
house, which became almost too much to bear when the servants
developed enough to understand that there were things they need
not bear. What will replace it, we do not yet know. It is too
early to talk of a revolutionary change into blocks of flats with
common kitchens, common dining-rooms, and common nurseries;
all that will come, has come, is extending, but it is not yet general.
The first step is the break-up of the Victorian house into maisonettes.
You can see this going on all over central London, where
two families now share a house built for one. Others are being
absorbed by the boarding-house. Briefly, we are packing closer
into the old spaciousness, partly because we do not need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
it for the purposes of ostentation, partly because we cannot
afford it.</p>

<p>Still, there is much left of old, bleak London, Highbury
Crescent, Warwick Street (Pimlico), Mornington Crescent, and
many others. There is, about those places, what there is more
proximately about Bayswater, a sense of past comfort, dating
back to the days when comfort meant red paper in the hall, brown
paint, thick stuff curtains, polished boards, large and straight
chairs with hard seats for the young, stuffed seats for the old.
Those houses were comfortable in a frowzy way; they were
houses in which one ate a great deal, slept a great deal, drank a
great deal, and thought within the limits of genteel taste. Little
by little people began to stay up later, so had less time to sleep;
then, their fathers having drunk too much, they found that their
inherited constitutions did not allow of similar excess, while the
intrusive foreigner brought in his curious dishes which taught us
to eat less, if more peculiarly. Picture galleries were opened on
Sunday, concerts were held upon that day; matinees, cinemas,
other pleasures, all these things making a continual call upon
time and purse, have stolen some of its privileges from the old
home, until it ceased to be home in the sacramental sense, a
pleasure in itself, and turned into a dormitory. The bleak old
houses of London have responded to this movement, by breaking
up into maisonettes, converting themselves into boarding-houses
and lodgings; there are now few claimants to their five floors;
indeed, the five floors grow more and more disliked. To-day,
when you walk along a street such as Mornington Crescent,
whose gray face wears the inscription: ‘Joy forbidden,’ you are
to a certain extent, labouring under an illusion, for the life behind
those gray fronts is not gray. It is, more and more, the life of
people who have no roots, who have settled for a short time in
rooms, whose employment is precarious, whose fortunes are
small, people who live on small weekly wages, or even on social
piracy, whose presence must cause uneasiness among the portly
Victorian ghosts. Inside those houses live few families, because
no families of wealth care to live in such districts, while poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
families cannot afford the servants to keep such houses clean.
So their dwellers are, many of them, adventurers, semi-respectable
people who have something to do with the stage, or who are in a
sort of way in the city. They never want the windows cleaned, and
when they sit down at the Victorian writing-desk with the waggly
legs, they care little if it is not dusted: they blow. That is the
end of those old houses; to-day, most of them are spinning out
the last of their long leases in a truly Victorian way: keeping up
appearances, and pretending to be as respectable as ever.</p>

<p>
AN ABSENT DESERT<br />
THE CROMWELL ROAD<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>In South Kensington and Bayswater, the bleakness is less
complete, because those districts are dimly in the West End,
with a little too much End about it. They are ‘possible’ districts,
as the phrase goes among some of us; a ‘possible’ district is one
the name of which can be stamped upon one’s note-paper. The
tenants of Bayswater and South Kensington number many of the
old-fashioned people who like quiet places, comfortable homes,
in some cases gardens, but many more are making of those places
a jumping-off ground. They pass through Bayswater or South
Kensington on the way to Mayfair, Belgravia, and Marylebone;
they are already well-to-do, and intend to be better-to-do; in
those places they associate with the people who, once upon a time,
were very well-to-do and are now less so; those districts are social
junctions. But everywhere the boarding-house is gaining ground,
and nowhere does one see this so well as in Cromwell Road.
Cromwell Road is a remarkable street; its length has, on a warm
and hazy day, a quality of eternity. It seems to have no beginning,
no end; one might walk for ever along its broad stretch, between
those high walls; a prison yard must be like that. This does not
mean that I dislike Cromwell Road; far from it; I visit it at least
once a week, for purposes of meditation. One can meditate in
Cromwell Road, because nothing ever seems to have happened
there; it certainly looks as if nothing could happen. It holds
no tragedy, no comedy. You pass along the endless series of
houses, all of which have four and a half or five and a half floors,
the half being accounted for by the servants’ rooms, to which the
Victorian builder never accorded a complete floor; they are nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
all alike, having five to nine steps, a porch on pillars, and a flat
face; the only difference between one house and another is the
age of their lease, the age being revealed by the condition of the
paint: some were repainted three years ago, some two years,
some recently. White, gray, black, such is their symphony. If
you look in at the windows of the dining-room you will generally
see a large mahogany table: in the middle of this stands a heavy
brass pot; in the brass pot grows a big green fern. Behind the
green fern, and always facing the window, stands a colossal sideboard,
surmounted by a mirror against which is outlined a
tantalus and sometimes, which is very regrettable, a cruet. (You
do not see a bottle of salad-dressing in Cromwell Road, but a little
farther west you do.) Near the tantalus sometimes dwell a silver
cup or two. On one side of the room you discern a mantelpiece,
decorated with coloured pots, a large, black marble clock, suitably
representing a tomb. There may also be some brass ash-trays
and bowls of obviously Indian pattern. The carpet one cannot
see, but I feel sure that it is generally a red and blue Turkey.
That is old Cromwell Road, grandpapa’s old Cromwell Road,
comfortable in its stifled sort of way. Rail as I may at the Victorian
period, I have a vague liking for those old solidities, that mean
pleasant, saddleback chairs, pipes (not cigarettes), the <i>Spectator</i>,
port, and evenings devoted to the reading of travel books
and memoirs (not novels). Dull, but solid, and in Cromwell
Road one is aware of a certain merit in solidity because it finds
itself at the point of flux between the old civilisation and the
new.</p>

<p>The new civilisation has already set its teeth into Cromwell
Road. The houses are unchanged, but a great many have been
bought up and joined together, decorated with stained glass,
re-named as hotels. These have fancy pots instead of brass pots,
ferns from strange bournes; curtains of lesser conventionality;
looking out from a window you no longer see Mary Jane in a pink
dress, but a sombre face, which may be that of a musician or a
poet; or of a Balkanic waiter stained with political conspiracy.
The inhabitants of those hotels are Americans, provincials, people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
who have grown tired of housekeeping and like to buy it ready-made;
they number many widows who behave as if they were
conscious of a transitory condition, actors, unattached people of
all kinds. These are not the old Cromwell Road people; they
are a new type, which you might call the Cromwell light-Roadster,
people who drive up in taxis at all times, and even after eleven
o’clock. Kensington means nothing to them; not one of them
will ever be an alderman. They are breaking up the Cromwell
Road, and many of those who read these lines will see Cromwell
Road without a private dwelling-house, except that here and
there a pair of very old maids, accompanied by some very fat dogs,
will stick to the old house. They will groan at the taxis which
stop at the Grand Imperial next door, send out an old retainer to
warn off the street band, and grumble at the electric underground,
just as they grumbled at the smoky steam underground. Then
they will die, and the Grand Imperial will extend its
possessions.</p>

<p>The Grand Imperial is extending all over London. Not
only have hotels, undreamt of twenty years ago, sprung up at
unexpected corners near the Strand and over the tube stations,
not only have they taken over anything between two and six
private houses at a time, but they are buying up site after site: a
big one in Piccadilly near Down Street, also the St George’s
Hospital site, perhaps. They are extending everywhere, communising
life. It is all very well saying that the hotel is a sign of
the decadent luxury of the day, but that is not true. In the first
place there is in hotels no such thing as decadent luxury; all that
the best offer are things such as plenty of light, air, space to move
in, electric light when you want it, hot water day and night, a
telephone by your bedside, a comfortable common room to write
in, a band to amuse you while you have your meals; such like
simple, obvious things which make up the ordinary comfort of
life. The old-fashioned people look upon this as luxury, but I
submit that the facility of having a hot bath when you want it is
a natural thing, and one of the first things that a developing
civilisation should give us all. Some people seem to think it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
morally wrong to be comfortable, and it shocks one to think that
so many of our best minds should, for so long, have been working
out ideas for pleasant and harmonious heating, lighting, cooking,
only to be told that they are pampering us. The whole object of
civilisation is to pamper us, to get rid of nature. Nature
is all very well in the summer numbers of the magazines;
it looks very pink and scented with hay, but real nature is rather
cold, damp, earwiggy, dark, always ill-drained, and much less
healthy than London. The object of civilisation is to reduce the
struggle for life, and to make the material side of it pleasant enough
to be forgotten. If that is not true, then let us back to the caveman
forthwith.</p>

<p>The truth is that hotels are not luxurious and not dear. It
sounds dear to pay a pound a day for a bedroom and your board,
which is what one paid before the war, but if one reflects that for
that pound one also has the use of excellent common rooms, that
one pays nothing whatever for all sorts of racking things such as
gas, electric light, water rate, borough rate, inhabited house duty,
house repairs, that one owes nothing to the sweep, no tips to
tradesmen, it is not dear. One has the space one needs to live in,
and that is the essence of the old-fashioned opposition to hotel life:
it does away with the large number of rooms that people used to
think they needed, rooms in which they shut themselves up
behind closed windows and drawn blinds. The old-fashioned
hate the simplification of life; they do not like to think
that people need no longer tie themselves down, define and
label themselves: hotels are meant for those who do not go to
the Zoo.</p>

<p>
BEASTS AT THE ZOO<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>Indeed, the Zoo is a tragic hint of the period we have just
left behind. It was founded in 1826, its object being, of course,
‘to further the study of animal life,’ but it did not very long retain
that character. The only character it retained was a sort of brutal
insensibility, a capacity for not understanding what it means to
animals, accustomed to run forty miles a day, or to fly out of sight,
to find themselves boxed up in small cages. The treatment of
animals in the Victorian period was very like the treatment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
children; people meant well by their children, which did not
prevent their constraining them to immobility on Sundays, forcing
them into careers they disliked, or into marriages with people they
detested. They were a sentimental and brutal generation, mainly
because they were stupid. So the Zoo, which is now a vulgar
gapery, remains as one of the ugly blots inherited by our people;
I hope to live long enough to see Parliament pass an act for
its suppression. It seems to me indecent that people who do not
know the difference between a leopard and a yak should, any
afternoon, for sixpence or a shilling, or on Sundays if they are
the friends or the servants of a Fellow, line up in hundreds outside
cages anything between six feet and thirty feet long, to see wretched
animals pace up and down, up and down eternally, or tragic birds
hop from an upper stick to a lower stick and then back again, not
one of them with the space for a full spring or a flight, sentenced
to penal servitude for life, a sentence which we inflict on no man
except for murder. I agree with Mr Galsworthy that the Zoo
is one of the saddest and most disgusting sights in the world.
At least, I know that I never leave the Zoo, which I seldom visit,
because it hurts me, without feeling a partner in a national crime.
You can defend vivisection by saying that it has valuable medical
results. I know nothing about that, but you cannot defend the
Zoo by saying that you give some snivelling boy an opportunity
to know what the mandril looks like. What is the use (I put it on
the lowest ground, that of use) of knowing what a mandril looks
like? And if it is of any use, is that use not counterbalanced by
the poison poured into that boy, which is that he shall consent to
the life-long imprisonment of a helpless creature?</p>

<p>This Zoo question was discussed in the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i> some
years ago; I think that one of the points, in defence, was that most
of the animals were born in the Zoo, and, knowing not liberty,
could not be unhappy. That may be, even if nothing in you
answers when you look into the eyes of the animals in those empty
cages where there is nothing to do, when all their nature, thousands
of generations of it, is calling in their blood to hunt and to fly.
Is not the test this: would you be satisfied if at birth your son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
were placed in a room eight feet by four, and told to grow up in it?
Do you really believe that he would be content when he reached
manhood? even if he had never known freedom. The truth is
represented by opinions such as that of the secretary of the Zoo,
Doctor Chalmers Mitchell, who summed up Mr Galsworthy’s attack
on the Zoo by saying: ‘Mr Galsworthy knows nothing about
the subject. His attack is rubbish, pure rubbish.’ It may be that,
on second thoughts, Doctor Chalmers Mitchell might find one or
two more arguments to put up against Mr Galsworthy, but this
one, while not lacking in force, somehow fails to convince. One
is more impressed by the argument of Mr J. D. Hamlyn, an
animal trainer, who said: ‘After the war, the business of importing
animals will go on exactly as it did before. In the first place, too
much capital is at stake, too much money has been expended to
give up the trade altogether.’ The only comment I have
to make on this is that this argument was continually used,
first in the West Indies, and later in the southern states of
America, when it was suggested that we should do away with
slavery.</p>

<p>Yes, the Zoo carries on to-day the old tradition of Victorian
brutality. But enough of the Zoo, and of its visitors, so like the
yokels at a fair, that guffaw with their heads through horse collars.
I would rather think that in a few of those Victorian places, sweet
old ladies in mauve silk and lace serve tea in Rockingham cups,
which they dust themselves for fear of Sarah Jane. One such
place is Crescent Grove. That is the sort of place one would
like to live in, when one feels rather older. It is near Clapham
Common, and, of course, it is a blind alley, so that no rude traffic
may pass up and down when the milkman has finished his melodious
round. The houses are clean, stuccoed, comfortable. The
knockers are cleaned every day. The glass is cleaned often, the
curtains are changed, and I am sure that when they go up, a whiff
of lavender spreads. Crescent Grove is, perhaps, a little too
clean; in those rooms where everything has its place, just as in
the past every one had his place, there must be so much order and
regularity of life that, as Mirbeau said: ‘On doit rudement s’embêter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
là-dedans.’ Still, at the very end of Crescent Grove, there is one
house that should be preserved as a monument of its period. Of
course, it is double-fronted; in front are planted evergreens, and
there is a drive. By the side runs a large garden beyond a wall;
on the other side of the wall one hears children at play. That is
the house to which father came back round about 1860, with his
top hat and his mutton-chop whiskers. If this description does
not convince you, let me give you the clinching fact: it is a private
road. Yet Crescent Grove stands very near to the suburbs. Not
far are Streatham, Tooting, the new streets of Clapham and
Brixton. Imbedded among the new streets are old houses with
columns, plaster fronts, stucco mouldings, squares surrounding
a single column that bears a moulting golden eagle, but the
suburbs are overwhelming them. These are not the inner suburbs,
such as Brixton, where the feeling is, on the whole, one of poverty
and dirt. Those inner suburbs have a certain vigour of coarse
life; thus, the Brixton Road is a place of immense activity,
notably round the great, open-air ironmonger, Williamson’s
Bonanza; there are shops and shops, nearly all of the multiple
type, Salmon and Gluckstein, Maypole Dairies, Home and Colonials,
the shops that Private Ortheris must have raved of in his Indian
delirium. Likewise, in Kilburn, where the Kilburn Bon Marché
and B. B. Evans struggle in zealous commercialism. Those inner
suburbs are hardly suburbs now, for the trams run through them
and bleed them of their population; tubes tap them; everywhere
the motor-buses stop. The true suburbs lie farther out. You
have to go well beyond the Brixton Bon Marché before you can
find such a place as Streatham, with its endless, well-kept, villa
streets of red brick houses, nearly all alike, creeper and grass plot
complete. Those suburbs outline a new social order; with a
little experience you can easily tell the thirty-five-pounds-a-year
street from the fifty-two-pounds-a-year street; you come with a
feeling of familiarity upon the corner house, where lives the doctor
or the surgeon. It is a new order, for all those houses are small,
manageable, clean, modern, in every way satisfactory, except that
they are all alike, made for people who may not be all alike, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
tend so to become. For if one buys one’s food, one’s clothes, one’s
furniture at the same big, local store, and if one takes one’s literature
from the same bookstall, one attains to a sort of nationality. But
it is not the nationality of the village, where local effort can develop
into art, because it develops slowly and creeps back upon itself.
In the suburbs everything is supplied on the model of central
London, and is turned out in hundreds of thousands by machines.
Perhaps the houses are made by machines. Maybe, one day the
people will be made by machines. Near those streets, all alike,
generally survives an older quarter of poor streets where live the
‘little women,’ the sweep, the turncock, the dependents of the
semi-poor; there, also, small shopkeepers live by undercutting
the big stores. They do this by selling the vegetables that are
too stale for the stores, by washing the linen which cannot be sent
to the steam laundry because it would fall to pieces, and especially
by lowering their own standard of living to the lowest possible
level. They are the last ramparts of suburban individualism,
and they will not last long. As time goes on, the bigger villa
streets, many of whose houses have pretensions, exemplified by
their architecture of concrete and tile, by their barbarous
roofs which make evil, dusty corners in the rooms, by the
select flowers in their front gardens, will turn away from
those little shops and, more and more, deal with Whiteley’s
and Harrod’s.</p>

<p>Thus, when one passes through London, from old Victorian
street to inner suburb, then to outer suburb, until one comes to
the spreading country of Tooting Bec Common, when one has
seen the homes of the rich, their marble solemnity, when one has
seen those of the poor in the grimy suburbs that cluster, and
emerges at last into those clean suburban streets, where in almost
every window an aspidistra wilts in its pot, one may grow a little
doubtful of the social revolution. We educate the poor, and
sometimes we give them their chance: the next step is the
aspidistra. The aspidistra goes to the grammar school; clever
aspidistra wins a scholarship and goes to Oxford. Then a
house is taken, let us say, in Barkston Gardens; instead of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
aspidistra it is marguerites in the window boxes. The marguerite
goes to Oxford as a matter of course, and may give place to
a lily in a green art-pot. By that time it understands nothing.
If it retains its money, the marguerite goes on having marguerites
potted in the window-boxes by the nurseryman; if it loses its
money, it goes back to the aspidistra. Upon this gloomy botanical
note I close this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<h2 class="chapheadleft">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subhead">CAFÉ ROYAL</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Why</span> did they call it Café Royal? It has nothing of the opulent
white and gold quality which naturally would go with such a
name, nothing expensive or elaborate. Here and there, in the
only room I know, namely, the café itself, is an escutcheon impressed
with the letter N. It makes one think of Napoleon, and the
name Café Royal clashes still more. But, after all, that matters very
little, for who cares what the Café Royal was? or under whose
auspices it was founded. I suppose that for antiquity it treads upon
the heels of Verrey’s; it has a flavour of 1870 rather than 1860;
what matters much more is that the Café Royal always savours
of the day, that it concentrates within itself more of the feeling of
the day, as exemplified by current art, than any other spot in this
country. Thus, when calling this chapter Café Royal, I do not
mean to devote it to an anecdotic study of the famous tavern, but
rather to those things which it represents and contains, to some
slight impression of the arts as they develop, flourish, and wilt in
this city. The Café itself should never have been called Royal,
for an eternal opposition exists between the pomp of such a name
and the rebellious young arts; in no essential do they oppose the
royal suggestion, but they are remote therefrom, live in a world
where the values are different, not related to class or fortune,
artificial, perhaps, but created in virtue of a private political
economy. Thus, the Café Royal should have been called something
dashing and picturesque, such as ‘Café des Mille Colonnes,’
or ‘Café de la Pomme Vermeille.’ How well it would have
looked, sparsely decorated with rubicund apples painted by
Cézanne! As it is, the Café Royal is a very large room in Regent
Street. Its ceiling, a mass of gold scrollings that embrace frescoes
darkened by smoke and time into the colour of old masters, is
sustained by many columns with a golden base and a green stem.
Round that stem intertwine golden leaves from which hang
golden grapes. The effect of the Café is one of rather excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
gilding: the walls are crowded with gilt figures and baskets of
flowers that leave space only for many mirrors; as if the wall
had been hidden away at the behest of some obscure modesty.
Yet the effect is pleasant, for this gold is old and tarnished. It
has nothing blatant, and the whole effect is one of comfortable
decency, as if this excessive room had been built by a parvenu,
but had been lived in so long by his successors as to lose the
parvenu spirit. The furnishing, plain tables with marble tops,
long seats with red plush backs, also resolve themselves into
good-humoured comfort, while, at the end, a prince of bars with
something like ten score bottles, each one filled with something
individual, produces an impression of eclectic welcome.</p>

<p>The Café Royal may have been built to astound, but nowadays
it is just the comfortable background of people who like to drink
a little, to pay moderately, and to talk enormously. The conversations
at the Café Royal are not, probably, such as would make
a good book of memoirs, but its mixed public has, at one time or
another, numbered everybody who did something (whatever
that may mean), so that many good things and many spiteful
ones are spoken every day under its golden roof. Before the war,
the violent young men and the much more violent young women
seemed to meet there every night, with an almost sacramental air,
to discuss, that is to scarify, reputations. That was good, for
Renan was right when he said that if a young man, aged twenty,
had not always ready a mouthful of insults for his predecessors,
he would pronounce no judgments fit to be heard when he attained
the age of forty.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the Café Royal is a literary café, or an
artistic café. The literary, dramatic, and pictorial elements are
certainly stronger there than in any other London resort, but at
any time you may see there the strangest assembly: foreigners,
a great many; smart people who are seeing life; and very dull,
ordinary, fat men who stop on their way from business or shop
to have a drink before dinner. At dinner time the room is not
itself, for half of it sees its marble tables covered with cloths,
which means that eating proceeds, and eating does not, so well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
drinking, favour turbulent debate. It is just before dinner, and
especially after dinner, that the Café Royal enters upon its true
function: to provide a pleasant, cheap place, fairly noisy, fairly
smoky, and fairly comfortable, where the young arts may meet
and joust. During the war it did not quite do this, for many
of the young men had joined the army, and it was strange suddenly
to recognise over a tunic, in a well-kept, well-brushed head, the
outlines of somebody whom once one knew with endless locks,
whiskers, or a beard. Even in khaki they did what they could.
Military discipline did not completely dominate those rebellious
beings; their moustaches were either a little more luxuriant or very
much more hogged than usual. The Café Royal platoon was still
faintly noticeable.</p>

<p>Some, however, were not in khaki, for theirs was not a very fit
generation, and even now many a table throws back a memory
to 1914. In those days the frequent visitor to the Café Royal
soon knew many people by sight, and if he was of that world, or
had somebody to guide him, he soon could pick out those who
were celebrated and those who were notorious; with time, he
even came to recognise those who were extremely well known.
I do not know if, nowadays, one often sees at the Café Royal,
Mr Jacob Epstein, but once it was difficult to detach one’s eyes
from the sleepy strength of his heavy profile. One wanted to
look into those eyes with the thick lids, in which strangely mingled
so much detachment and so much kinetic energy. He was seldom
alone; there was always a little Epstein group about his table.
Indeed, it is a characteristic of the Café Royal that few people sit
alone. They form groups. One I remember well. It always
contained a tall young man with very long, thin features, and
hair grown low about the cheek; he had a fancy for clothes faintly
1860 in feeling, notably, for stocks. There was an extremely
beautiful girl, thin, dark, and languid as some warm Italian greyhound.
There was a young man who wore a velvet coat, whose
fair hair fell in long wisps upon his collar, a strange young man,
with a peculiar grayish skin and an air of nervous excitement.
Round these moved other figures less definite, but all of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
young: square men in knickerbockers, with short pipes stuck
precisely in the middle of their faces; girls, outrageously florid
or eloquently simple, round whose long necks hung the flowered
yokes of Chelsea, on whose hands clustered many rings of turquoise
and aquamarine, or whose hands were virgin of all decoration
save that of black finger-nails. The smart people used to watch
them steadily and feel that, at last, they were really seeing life.</p>

<p>Sometimes they saw people whose names could serve as
conversation at the morrow’s lunch party. Sometimes they caught
sight of Mr C. R. W. Nevinson, and could describe his square
figure, his rather blunt, pleasant face with the bright, live, brown
eyes. It does one good to look at Mr Nevinson, though, nowadays,
something oppressed has crept into his expression; there is, in
those rather thick features, a sense of life and desire. With him
sometimes goes his wife, slight, white and rose, and bending a
little under the heavy sunshine of her hair.</p>

<p>Until recently the Café Royal also often contained Mr Augustus
John, and one could sit for a long time, wondering what it was
gave his features that air of tautness. There is always about
Mr John a feeling that he is imprisoned within himself....
Equally with Mr Epstein he had his court, young men in a state
of extreme reverence, and other men who preached to him in
attitudes of hostility tinged with nervousness, which is the ordinary
approach to the successful painter of those who are less successful.
I think that, now and then, Mr Arthur Symons used to draw
them away, so as to procure for Mr John a greater peace. It was
as if he were trying to create about him an atmosphere of hush.
At the Café Royal this is not easily done. Notably, it was difficult
to create hush among the reverential young men, for I suspect
that they all wanted to know what Mr John thought of their
work, that is meant to tell him what he ought to think. The
young women were more easily managed, and it is interesting to
note that they tended to approximate in appearance to the John
type. Nearly all were what the vulgar call plain, in some cases
because they were perfectly beautiful: that which is perfectly
beautiful is severe and separate; it does not arouse desire, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
arouses respect, and this most of humanity cannot forgive. Those
strange young women, apparently long-legged and long-armed,
in their simply-cut high frocks that hung straight from shoulder
to ankle, young women with hair plainly banded, rather long
noses, strong chins, thick, dark mouths, like open fruits. They
seemed to come straight out of some sketch in Donegal.</p>

<p>There were many others, too. Now and then one caught
sight of Mr Wyndham Lewis who, nowadays, is plump, but
in those was tall and white and rather slim, often silent and
generally weary; it was an education in negligence to watch the
depressed droop of the cigarette stump which generally hung
from his underlip. There were others, too, a woman with small,
humorous eyes and a pleasant coppery complexion, who wore
turbans of purple silk and gold, who never thought or spoke an
evil thing of any creature alive. One saw Mr Gertler, very young
and seductive, perhaps a little conscious of it; Mr Gilbert Cannan,
oozing defiance from every sharp angle and confining his conversation
to this process. The other young writers came now and
then: Mr Swinnerton before he grew his beard, Mr Hugh
Walpole, who always seemed slightly out of place in so ill-regulated
a spot. People less definable float through my mind: a young
girl who had been told that she looked like a Russian, and thenceforth
appeared attired in a red sarafan; a young man with black
locks massed upon his eyebrows, locks he often tossed back to
show the running water of his pale eyes. There was a young
woman who believed in asceticism; as she looked rather like a
brick, I was told that her beliefs had never been put to a rude test.
There was another young woman, too, who seriously informed
any marble table that she believed in reincarnation, and that
within her breathed the soul of Shelley. Nearly everybody
painted, some wrote verse, a few ventured on prose; the talk
was of art and of sinners against art. Swiftly they passed from
studio scandal to the declarations, manifestoes, proclamations
which made the arts sound foolish in 1914, but actually were
evidences of their vigour. Indeed, the modern forms of art tend
to shock the Philistine: I am not with him; I like my paint wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
The old arts are unkind to the young arts. Struck by a certain
wilful outrageousness which often overlays talent and in the
beginning always heralds it, the old arts make as much fun of the
new arts, as the old arts made of the older when they were young.
Some of my readers may remember Mr Epstein’s rather theoretical
Venus, at whose feet reposed a wheel. It was an abstract piece of
sculpture, but, however abstract, I think it was a little harsh of
Mrs Aria to describe it as a sick penguin sitting on a broken
bicycle. The truth is that the modern forms of art are not as
wilful or as intentionally shocking as their adepts choose to make
out. It may be true that most schools, from the impressionists
onwards, have formed round one man who had something original
to say in an original way, and that most of the pupils, having
nothing original to say, found it necessary to say it in a violently
original way. That is true to a certain extent; truer, perhaps,
is it to say that ‘genius creates the taste with which it is enjoyed.’
Thus, I think it quite as likely that people like Manet created the
taste for impressionism, just as Wagner created a taste for music
in reaction against, let us say, Rossini. Nature, after all, is only
a thing which one conceives, and not a thing which really exists;
it varies with the eye that beholds it, and if a man sincerely and
violently feels that trees are pink, then to him they are pink, and
if he has art enough to translate his temperament into those pink
trees, then the people who can understand him will learn to see
trees like him, that is, pink. We need not stress this, because it
is an extreme case, but I submit that the modern forms of art,
during the last dozen years, have all of them tended to express
nature on the lines of certain conventions, and that instead of
taking up an attitude of contempt, it was easy to understand
these conventions, therefore, to understand the artist, therefore,
to collect from the canvas the impression he painted there. Here,
I will be told by the Philistine: ‘Why should I see that a face
looks like a cube?’ Well, nobody wants to force him to see a
face as a cube if he doesn’t want to, but one is entitled to point out
to him that he has already accepted many conventions. He is
quite willing to look at Gainsborough’s ‘Blue Boy,’ and to see it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
as a human figure, though it has only surface and not volume.
He is quite willing to look at Venus of Milo and to accept it as a
reproduction of a beautiful woman, though it has no colour. He
is quite willing to go to a play the action of which extends
over five years, and to see this action condensed into two
and a half hours. The public has to accept the arts conventionally
because the arts do not reproduce nature, they
interpret it.</p>

THE A.A.A.<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>It may, therefore, be suggested that our young post-impressionists,
futurists, and cubists were badly treated by the public,
for the public never tried to understand the new conventions on
which they worked. With all the power of my sincerity, and in
the name of such honesty as may be in me, I assure my readers
that if they will take the trouble to master the conventions
the work can be interpreted. I possess an excellent non-representational
picture, by Mr Wadsworth, inspired by the
roofs of a Yorkshire village; it is entirely composed of black and
white planes. When, lately, this was shown to a friend, she
asked why she should be told to admire a set of decayed dominoes.
But the picture is not made up of decayed dominoes; it is a highly
simplified impression of walls and roofs, and when you have
sympathetically sought for what we may call the key plane, the
picture becomes absolutely obvious.</p>

<p>But what if it were not obvious? Many of the modern men,
such as Mr Wadsworth, Mr McKnight Kauffer, Mr Wyndham
Lewis, do not aspire to represent anything at all. What they
want to do is to sketch or paint an interesting pattern. Mr Ezra
Pound has put the attitude clearly in his book, <i>Gaudier Brzeska</i>,
where he says, more or less: ‘When you hear a sonata played,
you do not say, “Oh, what an eloquent reproduction of the waves
upon the shore!” or, “This is where the sheep begin to baa.”
What you do is to ask yourself whether this combination of sounds
is pleasant or moving. That is the freedom we wish to find in
painting or sculpture. We are not interested in painting the
Mayor of Leeds in such a way as to make it clear that he is a
mayor, possibly of Leeds, but we are interested in setting together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
lines and coloured surfaces, irrespective of any meaning, and to
be judged on that, according to whether these lines and colours
produce a pleasant sensation.’</p>

<p>This position appears to me above attack. The technical
improvements in painting, which began in the seventeenth century,
producing Rembrandt, Raphael, Velasquez, and, in due course,
Sir Edward Poynter, seem to have set a heavy yoke upon the
painter’s neck, for the painter grew enthralled by technique,
became more and more inclined to represent a baby so life-like
that everybody expected it to howl; he grew liable to lose sight
of the one thing that matters, namely, that to represent a baby is
nothing, and to represent the artist through the baby, everything.
(If I am wrong, consider a picture by Mr Clausen and a photograph
by Mr Park; Mr Clausen knows how to paint, but Mr Park
will far more exactly reproduce the sitter, do it quicker, and much
more cheaply.) The thesis of the modern artist, of which I am
trying to give an impression, therefore involves that while we
bow to the undeniable greatness of men such as Rembrandt,
Botticelli, Leonardo, we wonder whether a greater emancipation
from their technique might not have allowed them to soar higher
into the abstract region where none save an artist can breathe.
The plea is that in a more abstract field they might have been
still greater.</p>

<p>Undeniably, the modern forms of art have emancipated
themselves too much from technical restrictions. It is dangerous
to have too much technique; it is dangerous to have too little,
and I could not say who suavely broods in the golden mean. Still,
when we consider what a dead and damnable thing technique
alone can be, when we consider the annual mortuary at Burlington
House, when we stand awhile before a work of Mr Frank Dicksee,
and stare incredulously at Sir Luke Fildes’s ‘The Doctor,’ or
attempt to solve the Hon. John Collier’s psycho-pictorial mysteries,
we are indeed assured that though technique may exclude a man
both from heaven and from hell, it shall, for certain, land him in
purgatory.</p>

<p>I remember very well the first ‘advanced’ pictures I ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
saw. They were twelve impressions of a bridge over a brook by
Claude Monet. That must have been nearly twenty years ago,
and I thought them very beautiful. It is strange that nowadays
they seem so tame. But it does not matter to me that I thought
them beautiful then, just as when I first saw a Matisse I thought
it interesting, that my first Gauguin, with its queer brown
figures stirred me; it matters to me that when the futurists came
to town, Mr Marinetti did not strike me as a marionette, and that
later all the others, cubists, boulists, imagists, vorticists, were
taken by me as honest men. You may call me a fool; you may
even think worse of me and say that I was so anxious to be in the
movement that I liked every movement; I prefer to say that I
was always ready to try to understand a new pictorial convention.
When I cease to be able to do that, when I cease to see in painting
that Mr Wadsworth is deeply interesting, in literature, that Mr
James Joyce is strikingly individual, when I am Philistine enough
to hang a painter because I won’t hang his picture, then, indeed,
shall I be middle-aged and take to meals.</p>

<p>The years between 1908 or so and 1914 were some of the
most important English art has passed through. In those six or
seven years, for the first time, London saw the post-impressionists,
not only Matisse, but also Cézanne and Picasso; she saw the
futurists, the singular pictures of views from a moving train
which, faulty as they were, were well worth painting, because
from a moving train one does see things, therefore material for
art. She saw Severini’s ‘Pan-Pan Dance,’ where colour and
surface dance rather than men and women; she saw the coming
of Mr Epstein, first in the statues outside the British Medical
Association, which were said to be indecent and became famous;
she also saw reproductions of Mr Epstein’s Oscar Wilde
monument, which went to Paris and was said to be indecent and
became kilted. The cubists came in the train of Mr Metzinger.
The non-representational movement extended, radiating round
Mr Wyndham Lewis, impressing many men and women, among
whom, in those days, was found true ability. It was
a breathless and beautiful period, where everybody was under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
thirty and many were under twenty, when people painted not
for art’s sake, but consciously for the expression of self. When
that self was feeble, the painting was feeble. But it was not always
so. Many ridiculous things were done; many ridiculous things
were said in the Café Royal and out of it, but, as Miss May Sinclair
puts it very well, these young men had not come to destroy the
pictorial glories of the past; they had come to destroy their
imitators. Conscious of their period, they wanted to
express it.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that the modern forms of painting were
merely outbreaks of youth, that these movements had severed the
continuity which should exist between one period and another.
Now the modern young man is generally arrogant, and if you talked
to him of continuity would say, perhaps: ‘I don’t want any
ancestors; I am an ancestor.’ But he would be wrong. From
Monet to Matisse, from Matisse to the early Nevinson, from the
early Nevinson to the modern Wyndham Lewis, the link is close.
No doubt a pen better versed than mine could link Monet with
Giotto. I cannot; for I find it difficult to think back further than
fifty years.</p>

<p>
THE GOOD INTENT<br />
CHELSEA<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>There have been reactions. One of the most notable is that
of Mr Nevinson, who is to-day the most popular of the young
men, the one who has been most completely recognised by a
broad public. Certainly he has become more recognisable,
though I am not of those who think that his work has thereby
lost. A man may be great and esoteric, or he may be great and
lucid. It all depends on the way in which the dice fall. The
several exhibitions of Mr Nevinson’s work, during the war, have
shown him more and more gaining independence. He began
by adopting one of the cubist conventions; he is still able to do
so when he wishes, but he is also able to use other conventions,
even the most stereotyped, when his subject seems to demand it.
He paints pattern, or subject, or idea, but an interesting sidelight
on his attitude is hatred of all cliques. In the preface of his last
exhibition, he bitterly assails the people who seek ‘pure form
through nothing but still life, endless green apples, saucepans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and oranges, picasized and cezanned with a ponderous and self-conscious
sub-consciousness.’ He hates what he calls the
child-like antics and the gambolling of the elect of Bloomsbury.
He may not be quite fair, but when I remember the various
cliques to which I had occasional access, the Rhythm clique, for
whom nobody existed except Anne Estelle Rice, J. D. Fergusson,
Jessie Dismorr, and George Banks ... until the review changed
its name, when most of these people ceased to exist and nobody
but Mr Albert Rutherston was granted physical likelihood,
when I reflect how Mr Nevinson used to cluster with many others
in a cosy cube, only to be driven out at last at the point of a cone,
when I reflect upon the sombre mystery that surrounds the adepts
of Mr Roger Fry (a mystery recently grown less sombre with
success), I am assured that cliques are the necessary breeding-ground
of talent because they fortify its members against the
cackling Philistine. But they are also the thing which keeps
talent small and parochial once they have helped it to grow.
The clique is the nursery, and the test of a man is
whether he knows when he is grown up. The art clique
is like journalism, which can lead you anywhere provided you
forsake it.</p>

<p>Most of the cliques have their being in Chelsea, though
Fitzroy Square and the Garden City occasionally put forward
claims, and Bedford Park asserts itself. I suspect that the movement
is nowadays away from Chelsea. King’s Road grows every
day more mercantile; nothing in it recalls the arts except a slight
excess of shops which sell artists’ materials. One does meet
the Chelsea girl, no longer in a jibbah, but more likely in an
eloquent sweater, with her hair cut short and her feet brogued,
but then the Chelsea style has crept into many circles. You can
go into the Chenil Gallery, where you will always find works by
Mr Augustus John and Mr Gill; you can even go and have
lunch at the Good Intent, but somehow Chelsea will not seem to
you very Chelsea-ish. Indeed, there are rows and rows of studios
near Glebe Place, Church Street, Redcliffe Square, in all sorts of
odd back-yards and shanties, but the whole thing does not hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
together. At the Good Intent, for instance, you will find a small,
quiet restaurant, decorated with old furniture, pictures that may
have been advanced once upon a time, a jolly old pug, very fat
and wheezing, its portraits on the wall, grossly flattered, with a
mauve ribbon round its neck; you will see at the tables mainly
women who live at local diggings, rather tired and lonely looking,
as women grow when they live in diggings and toast muffins on
the gas stove.</p>

<p>No, Chelsea is nowadays too successful to be a locality for
artists. Cheyne Walk has become too famous and too rich, for
artists cannot live together, unless it is in a sort of Alsatia where
you must pay your footing in such coin as the keeper thinks fit.
Nowadays, the arts tend to scatter. They can be found in Chalk
Farm, even in Paddington, some say in Bayswater, though this is
not likely. They tend to live more privately than they do in Paris,
where half the day seems to be spent at the Lilas. (Oh, how I
hate the Lilas! The last time I went there, there was an enormous
crowd; a hairy Russian philosopher stood on my right foot while
he read bad French translations from the Sanskrit; meanwhile,
two young people stood on my left foot and made love.) In
London the arts meet at their communal places, in certain
restaurants which they discover and then forsake, at the Coq d’Or,
at little dancing clubs. If only the Philistine hated them more,
they might cling closer.</p>

<p>Still, the arts are not, in London, as absent and ignored as the
foreigner likes to think. It is true, as Mr Nevinson says, that
owing chiefly to our Press, to our loathsome, tradition-loving
public schools and our antiquity-stinking universities, the average
Englishman is not merely suspicious of the new in all intellectual
and artistic experiment, but he is mentally trained to be so unsportsmanlike
as to try to kill every new endeavour in embryo.
It is true, but it does not matter. The arts are vigorous, and in the
end, those who came to kill stay to buy. That will be seen as
time goes on.</p>

<p>Is it, I wonder, a symptom of the English attitude to the arts,
that the chapter which concerns them should, in the words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Mr Henry James, drag far in the dusty rear of this book? Perhaps,
though London of to-day is so vivid and so eloquent, so full of
sharp colour and true line that, when I consider her music, I am
inclined to think that she would not have attained her crisp and
harmonious form if some creative instinct within her humorous,
pessimistic, and languid people had not presided over her birth,
and favoured her composite life.</p>
